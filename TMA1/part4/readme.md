For this project, you are required to develop a web application that can provide users with the following utility tools:
• (10 marks) Measurement converters: weights, lengths, areas, and volumes
• (10 marks) A mortgage calculator
• (10 marks) A utility tool that you think could be useful. You may need to do some research on the Web to build this last tool, and in the report you need to justify why you think it will be useful.

In order to get full marks for the above design and implementation, the following are required:

[ x ] - It must have an integrated and user-friendly interface for users to access each of the tools you designed.

[ ] - You need to use JavaScript functions and built-in objects to implement the application.

[ x ] - At any time only one tool will be shown, to ensure a clean and tidy space for users to work with.

[ ] - You need to use Ajax technologies to eliminate whole page update when switching from one utility to another.

[ ] - You need to use event handler to calculate and show the result as soon as the user has given enough input to the system.

[ ] - In the assignment report, you need to provide sufficient documentation for your work, including algorithms and formulas used for the tools. If you have used any resources, including documents on the Web, you must clearly identify the source in your documentation

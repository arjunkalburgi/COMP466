						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							The GenBank sequence database is an annotated collection of all publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein translations. This database is produced at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as part of an international collaboration with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Data Library from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). GenBank and its collaborators receive sequences produced in laboratories throughout the world from more than 100,000 distinct organisms. GenBank continues to grow at an exponential rate, doubling every 10 months. Release 134, produced in February 2003, contained over 29.3 billion nucleotide bases in more than 23.0 million sequences. GenBank is built by direct submissions from individual laboratories, as well as from bulk submissions from large-scale sequencing centers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Direct submissions are made to GenBank using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BankIt</ext-link>, which is a Web-based form, or the stand-alone submission program, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sequin</ext-link>. Upon receipt of a sequence submission, the GenBank staff assigns an Accession number to the sequence and performs quality assurance checks. The submissions are then released to the public database, where the entries are retrievable by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Entrez</ext-link>or downloadable by FTP. Bulk submissions of Expressed Sequence Tag (EST), Sequence Tagged Site (STS), Genome Survey Sequence (GSS), and High-Throughput Genome Sequence (HTGS) data are most often submitted by large-scale sequencing centers. The GenBank direct submissions group also processes complete microbial genome sequences.

						<title>History</title>
						<p>
							Initially, GenBank was built and maintained at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). In the early 1990s, this responsibility was awarded to NCBI through congressional mandate. NCBI undertook the task of scanning the literature for sequences and manually typing the sequences into the database. Staff then added annotation to these records, based upon information in the published article. Scanning sequences from the literature and placing them into GenBank is now a rare occurrence. Nearly all of the sequences are now deposited directly by the labs that generate the sequences. This is attributable to, in part, a requirement by most journal publishers that nucleotide sequences are first deposited into publicly available databases (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) so that the Accession number can be cited and the sequence can be retrieved when the article is published. NCBI began accepting direct submissions to GenBank in 1993 and received data from LANL until 1996. Currently, NCBI receives and processes about 20,000 direct submission sequences per month, in addition to the approximately 200,000 bulk submissions that are processed automatically.

						<title>International Collaboration</title>
						<p>
							In the mid-1990s, the GenBank database became part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration with the EMBL database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">European Bioinformatics Institute</ext-link>, Hinxton, United Kingdom) and the Genome Sequence Database (GSDB; LANL, Los Alamos, NM). Subsequently, the GSDB was removed from the Collaboration (by the National Center for Genome Resources, Santa Fe, NM), and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">DDBJ</ext-link>(Mishima, Japan) joined the group. Each database has its own set of submission and retrieval tools, but the three databases exchange data daily so that all three databases should contain the same set of sequences. Members of the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank staff meet annually to discuss technical issues, and an international advisory board meets with the database staff to provide additional guidance. An entry can only be updated by the database that initially prepared it to avoid conflicting data at the three sites.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Collaboration created a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/index.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Feature Table Definition</ext-link>that outlines legal features and syntax for the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank feature tables. The purpose of this document is to standardize annotation across the databases. The presentation and format of the data are different in the three databases, however, the underlying biological information is the same.

						<title>Confidentiality of Data</title>
						<p>
							When scientists submit data to GenBank, they have the opportunity to keep their data confidential for a specified period of time. This helps to allay concerns that the availability of their data in GenBank before publication may compromise their work. When the article containing the citation of the sequence or its Accession number is published, the sequence record is released. The database staff request that submitters notify GenBank of the date of publication so that the sequence can be released without delay. The request to release should be sent to <email>gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>.

						<title>Direct Submissions</title>
						<p>
							The typical GenBank submission consists of a single, contiguous stretch of DNA or RNA sequence with annotations. The annotations are meant to provide an adequate representation of the biological information in the record. The GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/index.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Feature Table Definition</ext-link>describes the various features and subsequent qualifiers agreed upon by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, only nucleotide sequences are accepted for direct submission to GenBank. These include mRNA sequences with coding regions, fragments of genomic DNA with a single gene or multiple genes, and ribosomal RNA gene clusters. If part of the nucleotide sequence encodes a protein, a conceptual translation, called a CDS(coding sequence), is annotated. The span of the CDS feature is mapped to the nucleotide sequence encoding the protein. A protein Accession number (/protein_id) is assigned to the translation product, which will subsequently be added to the protein databases.
						</p>
						<p>
							Multiple sequences can be submitted together. Such batch submissions of non-related sequences may be processed together but will be displayed in Entrez (Chapter 15) as single records. Alternatively, by using the Sequin submission tool (Chapter 12), a submitter can specify that several sequences are biologically related. Such sequences are classified as environmental sample sets, population sets, phylogenetic sets, mutation sets, or segmented sets. Each sequence within a set is assigned its own Accession number and can be viewed independently in Entrez. However, with the exception of segmented sets, each set is also indexed within the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Popset" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PopSet</ext-link>division of Entrez, thus allowing scientists to view the relationship between the sequences.
						</p>
						<p>
							What defines a set? Environmental sample, population, phylogenetic, and mutation sets all contain a group of sequences that spans the same gene or region of the genome. Environmental samples are derived from a group of unclassified or unknown organisms. A population set contains sequences from different isolates of the same organism. A phylogenetic set contains sequences from different organisms that are used to determine the phylogenetic relationship between them. Sequencing multiple mutations within a single gene gives rise to a mutation set.
						</p>
						<p>
							All sets, except segmented sets, may contain an alignment of the sequences within them and might include external sequences already present in the database. In fact, the submitter can begin with an existing alignment to create a submission to the database using the Sequin submission tool. Currently, Sequin accepts FASTA+GAP, PHYLIP, MACAW, NEXUSInterleaved, and NEXUS Contiguous alignments. Submitted alignments will be displayed in the PopSet section of Entrez.
						</p>
						<p>
							Segmented sets are a collection of noncontiguous sequences that cover a specified genetic region. The most common example is a set of genomic sequences containing exons from a single gene where part or all of the intervening regions have not been sequenced. Each member record within the set contains the appropriate annotation, exon features in this case. However, the mRNA and CDS will be annotated as joined features across the individual records. Segmented sets themselves can be part of an environmental sample, population, phylogenetic, or mutation set.

						<title>Bulk Submissions: High-Throughput Genomic Sequence (HTGS)</title>
						<p>
							HTGSentries are submitted in bulk by genome centers, processed by an automated system, and then released to GenBank. Currently, about 30 genome centers are submitting data for a number of organisms, including human, mouse, rat, rice, and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the malaria parasite.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">HTGS</ext-link>data are submitted in four phases of completion: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Phase 0 sequences are one-to-few reads of a single clone and are not usually assembled into contigs. They are low-quality sequences that are often used to check whether another center is already sequencing a particular clone. Phase 1 entries are assembled into contigs that are separated by sequence gaps, the relative order and orientation of which are not known (Figure 1). Phase 2 entries are also unfinished sequences that may or may not contain sequence gaps. If there are gaps, then the contigs are in the correct order and orientation. Phase 3 sequences are of finished quality and have no gaps. For each organism, the group overseeing the sequencing effort determines the definition of finished quality.

						</p>
						<p>
							Phase 0, 1, and 2 records are in the HTG division of GenBank, whereas phase 3 entries go into the taxonomic division of the organism, for example, PRI (primate) for human. An entry keeps its Accession number as it progresses from one phase to another but receives a new Accession.Version number and a new gi number each time there is a sequence change.

						<title>Submitting Data to the HTG Division</title>
						<p>
							To submit sequences in bulk to the HTG processing system, a center or group must set up an FTP account by writing to <email>htgs-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. Submitters frequently use two tools to create HTG submissions,   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/sequininfo.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sequin</ext-link>or   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/fa2htgsinfo.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">fa2htgs</ext-link>. Both of these tools require   FASTA-formatted sequence, i.e., a definition line beginning with a greater than sign (&gt;) followed by a unique identifier for the sequence. The raw sequence appears on the lines after the definition line. For sequences composed of contigs separated by gaps, a   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/sequininfo.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">modified FASTA format</ext-link>is used. In addition, Sequin users must modify the Sequin configuration file so that the HTG genome center features are enabled.
						</p>
						<p>
							fa2htgs is a command-line program that is downloaded to the user's computer. The submitter invokes a script with a series of parameters (arguments) to create a submission. It has an advantage over Sequin in that it can be set up by the user to create submissions in bulk from multiple files.
						</p>
						<p>
							Submissions to HTG must contain three identifiers that are used to track each HTG record: the genome center tag, the sequence name, and the Accession number. The genome center tag is assigned by NCBI and is generally the FTP account login name. The sequence name is a unique identifier that is assigned by the submitter to a particular clone or entry and must be unique within the group's submissions. When a sequence is first submitted, it has only a sequence name and genome center tag; the Accession number is assigned during processing. All updates to that entry must include the center tag, sequence name, and Accession number, or processing will fail.

						<title>
							The HTG Processing Pathway
						</title>
						<p>
							Submitters deposit HTGS sequences in the form of Seq-submit files generated by Sequin, fa2htgs, or their own   ASN.1dumper tool into the SEQSUBMIT directory of their FTP account. Every morning, scripts automatically pick up the files from the FTP site and copy them to the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/processing.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">processing</ext-link>pathway, as well as to an archive. Once processing is complete and if there are no errors in the submission, the files are automatically loaded into GenBank. The processing time is related to the number of submissions that day; therefore, processing can take from one to many hours.
						</p>
						<p>
							Entries can fail HTG processing because of three types of problems: 
							<list list-type="arabic">
								<list-item id="bid.11">
									<label>
										1
									</label>
									<p>
										Formatting: submissions are not in the proper Seq-submit format.
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.12">
									<label>
										2
									</label>
									<p>
										Identification: submissions may be missing the genome center tag, sequence name, or Accession number, or this information is incorrect.
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.13">
									<label>
										3
									</label>
									<p>
										Data: submissions have problems with the data and therefore fail the validator checks.
									</p>
								</list-item>
							</list>
						</p>
						<p>
							When submissions fail HTG processing, a GenBank annotator sends email to the sequencing center, describing the problem and asking the center to submit a corrected entry. Annotators do not fix incorrect submissions; this ensures that the staff of the submitting genome center fixes the problems in their database as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							The processing pathway also generates reports. For successful submissions, two files are generated: one contains the submission in GenBank flat file format (without the sequence); and another is a status report file. The status report file, ac4htgs, contains the genome center, sequence name, Accession number, phase, create date, and update date for the submission. Submissions that fail processing receive an error file with a short description of the error(s) that prevented processing. The GenBank annotator also sends email to the submitter, explaining the errors in further detail.

						<title>Whole Genome Shotgun Sequences (WGS)</title>
						<p>
							Genome centers are taking multiple approaches to sequencing complete genomes from a number of organisms. In addition to the traditional clone-based sequencing whose data are being submitted to HTGS, these centers are also using a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/wgs.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">WGS</ext-link>approach to sequence the genome. The shotgun sequencing reads are assembled into contigs, which are now being accepted for inclusion in GenBank. WGS contig assemblies may be updated as the sequencing project progresses and new assemblies are computed. WGS sequence records may also contain annotation, similar to other GenBank records.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each sequencing project is assigned a stable project ID, which is made up of four letters. The Accession number for a WGS sequence contains the project ID, a two-digit version number, and six digits for the contig ID. For instance, a project would be assigned an Accession number AAAX00000000. The first assembly version would be AAAX01000000. The last six digits of this ID identify individual contigs. A master record for each assembly is created. This master record contains information that is common among all records of the sequencing project, such as the biological source, submitter, and publication information. There is also a link to the range of Accession numbers for the individual contigs in this assembly.
						</p>
						<p>
							WGS submissions can be created using tbl12asn, a utility that is packaged with the Sequin submission software. Information on submitting these sequences can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/wgs.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Whole Genome Shotgun Submissions</ext-link>.

						<title>Bulk Submissions: EST, STS, and GSS</title>
						<p>
							Expressed Sequence Tags (EST), Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs), and Genome Survey Sequences (GSSs) sequences are generally submitted in a batch and are usually part of a large sequencing project devoted to a particular genome. These entries have a streamlined submission process and undergo minimal processing before being loaded to GenBank.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EST</ext-link>s are generally short (&lt;1 kb), single-pass cDNAsequences from a particular tissue and/or developmental stage. However, they can also be longer sequences that are obtained by differential display or Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) experiments. The common feature of all ESTs is that little is known about them; therefore, they lack feature annotation.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbSTS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">STS</ext-link>s are short genomic landmark sequences (
							1). They are operationally unique in that they are specifically amplified from the genome by PCR amplification. In addition, they define a specific location on the genome and are, therefore, useful for mapping.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GSS</ext-link>s are also short sequences but are derived from genomic DNA, about which little is known. They include, but are not limited to, single-pass GSSs, BACends, exon-trappedgenomic sequences, and AluPCRsequences.
						</p>
						<p>
							EST, STS, and GSS sequences reside in their respective divisions within GenBank, rather than in the taxonomic division of the organism. The sequences are maintained within GenBank in the dbEST, dbSTS, and dbGSS databases.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.16">
							<title>Submitting Data to dbEST, dbSTS, or dbGSS</title>
							<p>
								Because of the large numbers of sequences that are submitted at once, dbEST, dbSTS, and dbGSS entries are stored in relational databases where information that is common to all sequences can be shared. Submissions consist of several files containing the common information, plus a file of the sequences themselves. The three types of submissions have different requirements, but all include a Publication file and a Contact file. See the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbEST</ext-link>,   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbSTS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbSTS</ext-link>, and   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbGSS</ext-link>pages for the specific requirements for each type of submission.
							</p>
							<p>
								In general, users generate the appropriate files for the submission type and then email the files to <email>atch-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. If the files are too big for email, they can be deposited into a FTP account. Upon receipt, the files are examined by a GenBank annotator, who fixes any errors when possible or contacts the submitter to request corrected files. Once the files are satisfactory, they are loaded into the appropriate database and assigned Accession numbers. Additional formatting errors may be detected at this step by the data-loading software, such as double quotes anywhere in the file or invalid characters in the sequences. Again, if the annotator cannot fix the errors, a request for a corrected submission is sent to the user. After all problems are resolved, the entrie  are loaded into GenBank.

								<title>Bulk Submissions: HTC and FLIC</title>
								<p>
									HTC records are High-Throughput cDNA/mRNA submissions that are similar to ESTs but often contain more information. For example, HTC entries often have a systematic gene name (not necessarily an official gene name) that is related to the lab or center that submitted them, and the longest open reading frame is often annotated as a coding region.
								</p>
								<p>
									FLIC records, Full-Length Insert cDNA, contain the entire sequence of a cloned cDNA/mRNA. Therefore, FLICs are generally longer, and sometimes even full-length, mRNAs. They are usually annotated with genes and coding regions, although these may be lab systematic names rather than functional names.
								</p>
								<sec id="bid.1739">
									<title>HTC Submissions</title>
									<p>
										HTC entries are usually generated with   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sequin</ext-link>or   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">tbl2asn</ext-link>, and the files are emailed to <email>gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. If the files are too big for email, then by prior arrangement, the submitter can deposit the files by FTP and send a notification to <email>gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>that files are on the FTP site.
									</p>
									<p>
										HTC entries undergo the same validation and processing as non-bulk submissions. Once processing is complete, the records are loaded into GenBank and are available in Entrez and other retrieval systems.
									</p>
								</sec>
								<sec id="bid.1740">
									<title>FLIC Submissions</title>
									<p>
										FLICs are processed via an automated FLIC processing system that is based on the HTG automated processing system. Submitters use the program tbl2asn to generate their submissions. As with HTG submissions, submissions to the automated FLIC processing system must contain three identifiers: the genome center tag, the sequence name (SeqId), and the Accession number. The genome center tag is assigned by NCBI and is generally the FTP account login name. The sequence name is a unique identifier that is assigned by the submitter to a particular clone or entry and must be unique within the group's FLIC submissions. When a sequence is first submitted, it has only a sequence name and genome center tag; the Accession number is assigned during processing. All updates to that entry include the center tag, sequence name, and Accession number, or processing will fail.

										The FLIC processing system is analogous to the HTG processing system. Submitters deposit their submissions in the FLICSEQSUBMIT directory of their FTP account and notify us that the submissions are there. We then run the scripts to pick up the files from the FTP site and copy them to the processing pathway, as well as to an archive. Once processing is complete and if there are no errors in the submission, the files are automatically loaded into GenBank.
									</p>
									<p>
										As with HTG submissions, FLIC entries can fail for three reasons: problems with the format, problems with the identification of the record (the genome center, the SeqId, or the Accession number), or problems with the data itself. When submissions fail FLIC processing, a GenBank annotator sends email to the sequencing center, describing the problem and asking the center to submit a corrected entry. Annotators do not fix incorrect submissions; this ensures that the staff of the submitting genome center fixes the problems in their database as well. At the completion of processing, reports are generated and deposited in the submitter's FTP account, as described for HTG submissions.

								<title>Submission Tools</title>
								<p>
									Direct submissions to GenBank are prepared using one of two submission tools, BankIt or Sequin.
								</p>
								<sec id="bid.19">
									<title>BankIt</title>
									<p>
										<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BankIt</ext-link>is a Web-based form that is a convenient and easy way to submit a small number of sequences with minimal annotation to GenBank. To complete the form, a user is prompted to enter submitter information, the nucleotide sequence, biological source information, and features and annotation pertinent to the submission. BankIt has extensive   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/help.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Help</ext-link>documentation to guide the submitter. Included with the Help document is a set of annotation examples that detail the types of information that are required for each type of submission. After the information is entered into the form, BankIt transforms this information into a GenBank   flatfilefor review. In addition, a number of quality assurance and validation checks ensure that the sequence submitted to GenBank is of the highest quality. The submitter is asked to include spans (sequence coordinates) for the coding regions and other features and to include amino acid sequence for the proteins that derive from these coding regions. The BankIt validator compares the amino acid sequence provided by the submitter with the conceptual translation of the coding region based on the provided spans. If there is a discrepancy, the submitter is requested to fix the problem, and the process is halted until the error is resolved. To prevent the deposit of sequences that contain cloning vector sequence, a   BLASTsimilarity search is performed on the sequence, comparing it to the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/VecScreen.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">VecScreen</ext-link>database. If there is a match to this database, the user is asked to remove the contaminating vector sequence from their submission or provide an explanation as to why the screen was positive. Completed forms are saved in ASN.1 format, and the entry is submitted to the GenBank processing queue. The submitter receives confirmation by email, indicating that the submission process was successful.
									</p>
								</sec>
								<sec id="bid.20">
									<title>Sequin</title>
									<p>
										<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sequin</ext-link>is more appropriate for complicated submissions containing a significant amount of annotation or many sequences. It is a stand-alone application available on NCBI's   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/sequin/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">FTP</ext-link>site. Sequin creates submissions from nucleotide and amino acid sequences in FASTA format with tagged biological source information in the FASTA definition line. As in BankIt, Sequin has the ability to predict the spans of coding regions. Alternatively, a submitter can specify the spans of their coding regions in a   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">five-column, tab-delimited table</ext-link>and import that table into Sequin. For submitting multiple, related sequences, e.g., those in a phylogenetic or population study, Sequin accepts the output of many popular multiple sequence-alignment packages, including FASTA+GAP, PHYLIP, MACAW, NEXUS Interleaved, and NEXUS Contiguous. It also allows users to annotate features in a single record or a set of records globally. For more information on Sequin, see   Chapter 12.
									</p>
									<p>
										Completed Sequin submissions should be emailed to GenBank at <email>gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. Larger files may be submitted by   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LargeDirSubs/dir_submit.cgi" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SequinMacrosend</ext-link>.

								<sec id="bid.22">
									<title>Triage</title>
									<p>
										All direct submissions to GenBank, created either by Sequin or BankIt, are processed by the GenBank annotation staff. The first step in processing submissions is called triage. Within 48 hours of receipt, the database staff reviews the submission to determine whether it meets the minimal criteria for incorporation into GenBank and then assigns an Accession number to each sequence. All sequences must be &gt;50 bp in length and be sequenced by, or on behalf of, the group submitting the sequence. GenBank will not accept sequences constructed   <italic>in silico</italic>; noncontiguous sequences containing internal, unsequenced spacers; or sequences for which there is not a physical counterpart, such as those derived from a mix of genomic DNA and mRNA. Submissions are also checked to determine whether they are new sequences or updates to sequences submitted previously. After receiving Accession numbers, the sequences are put into a queue for more extensive processing and review by the annotation staff.
									</p>
								</sec>
								<sec id="bid.23">
									<title>Indexing</title>
									<p>
										Triaged submissions are subjected to a thorough examination, referred to as the indexing phase. Here, entries are checked for: 
										<list list-type="arabic">
											<list-item id="bid.24">
												<label>
													1
												</label>
												<p>
													Biological validity. For example, does the conceptual translation of a coding region match the amino acid sequence provided by the submitter? Annotators also ensure that the source organism name and lineage are present, and that they are represented in NCBI's taxonomy database. If either of these is not true, the submitter is asked to correct the problem. Entries are also subjected to a series of BLAST similarity searches to compare the annotation with existing sequences in GenBank.
												</p>
											</list-item>
											<list-item id="bid.25">
												<label>

													Formatting and spelling. If there are problems with the sequence or annotation, the annotator works with the submitter to correct them.
												</p>
											</list-item>
										</list>
									</p>
									<p>
										Completed entries are sent to the submitter for a final review before release into the public database. If the submitters requested that their sequences be released after processing, they have 5 days to make changes prior to release. The submitter may also request that GenBank hold their sequence until a future date. The sequence must become publicly available once the Accession number or the sequence has been published. The GenBank annotation staff currently processes about 1,900 submissions per month, corresponding to approximately 20,000 sequences.
									</p>
									<p>
										GenBank annotation staff must also respond to email inquiries that arrive at the rate of approximately 200 per day. These exchanges address a range of topics including: 
										<list list-type="bullet">
											<list-item id="bid.28">

										One annotator is responsible for handling all email received in a 24-hour period, and all messages must be acted upon and replied to in a timely fashion. Replies to previous emails are forwarded to the appropriate annotator.
									</p>
								</sec>
								<sec id="bid.35">
									<title>Processing Tools</title>
									<p>
										The annotation staff uses a variety of tools to process and update sequence submissions. Sequence records are edited with Sequin, which allows staff to annotate large sets of records by global editing rather than changing each record individually. This is truly a time saver because more than 100 entries can be edited in a single step (see   Chapter 12on Sequin for more details). Records are stored in a database that is accessed through a queue management tool that automates some of the processing steps, such as looking up taxonomy and PubMed data, starting BLAST jobs, and running automatic validation checks. Hence, when an annotator is ready to start working on an entry, all of this information is ready to view. In addition, all of the correspondence between GenBank staff and the submitter is stored with the entry. For updates to entries already present in the public database, the live version of the entry is retrieved from ID, and after making changes, the annotator loads the entry back into the public database. This entry is available to the public immediately after loading.

								<title>Microbial Genomes</title>
								<p>
									The GenBank direct submissions group has processed more than 50 complete microbial genomes since 1996. These genomes are relatively small in size compared with their eukaryotic counterparts, ranging from five hundred thousand to five million bases. Nonetheless, these genomes can contain thousands of genes, coding regions, and structural RNAs; therefore, processing and presenting them correctly is a challenge. Currently, the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration has a 350-kilobase (kb) upper size limit for sequence entries. Because a complete bacterial genome is larger than this arbitrary limit, it must be split into pieces. GenBank routinely splits complete microbial genomes into 10-kb pieces with a 60-bp overlap between pieces. Each piece contains approximately 10 genes. A CON entry, containing instructions on how to put the pieces back together, is also made. The CON entry contains descriptor information, such as source organism and references, as well as a join statement providing explicit instructions on how to generate the complete genome from the pieces. The Accession number assigned to the CON record is also added as a secondary Accession number on each of the pieces that make up the complete genome (see Figure 2).

									<title>Submitting and Processing Data</title>
									<p>
										Submitters of complete genomes are encouraged to contact us at 
										<email>genomes@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>before preparing their entries. A FTP account is required to submit large files, and the submission should be deposited at least 1 month before publication to allow for processing time and coordinated release before publication. In addition, submitters are required to follow certain guidelines, such as providing unique identifiers for proteins and systematic names for all genes. Entries should be prepared with the submission tool   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">tbl2asn</ext-link>, a utility that is part of the Sequin package (  Chapter 12). This utility creates an ASN.1 submission file from a five-column, tab-delimited file containing feature annotation, a FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequence, and an optional FASTA-formatted protein sequence.
									</p>
									<p>
										Complete genome submissions are reviewed by a member of the GenBank annotation staff to ensure that the annotation and gene and protein identifiers are correct, and that the entry is in proper GenBank format. Any problems with the entry are resolved through communication with the submitter. Once the record is complete, the genome is carefully split into its component pieces. The genome is split so that none of the breaks occurs within a gene or coding region. A member of the annotation staff performs quality assurance checks on the set of genome pieces to ensure that they are correct and representative of the complete genome. The pieces are then loaded into GenBank, and the CON record is created.

								<title>Third Party Annotation (TPA) Sequence Database</title>
								<p>
									The vast amount of publicly available data from the human genome project and other genome sequencing efforts is a valuable resource for   scientists throughout the world. A laboratory studying a particular gene   or gene family may have sequenced numerous cDNAs but has neither the   resources nor inclination to sequence large genomic regions containing   the genes, especially when the sequence is available in public   databases. The researcher might choose then to download genomic   sequences from GenBank and perform experimental analyses on these   sequences. However, because this researcher did not perform the   sequencing, the sequence, with its new annotations, cannot be submitted   to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. This is unfortunate because important scientific   information is being excluded from the public databases. To address this   problem, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration   established a separate section of the database for such TPA (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/tpa.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Third Party Annotation Sequence Database</ext-link>).
								</p>
								<p>
									All sequences in the TPA database are derived from the publicly   available collection of sequences in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. Researchers can   submit both new and alternative annotations of genomic sequence to   GenBank. TPA entries can be also created by combining the exon sequences   from genomic sequences or by making contigs of EST sequences to make   mRNA sequences. TPA submissions must use sequence data that are already   represented in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank, have annotation that is experimentally   supported, and appear in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. TPA   sequences will be released to the public database only when their   Accession numbers and/or sequence data appear in a peer-reviewed   publication in a biological journal.

						<p>
							PubMed is a database developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), one of the institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The database was designed to provide access to citations (with abstracts) from biomedical journals. Subsequently, a linking feature was added to provide access to full-text journal articles at Web sites of participating publishers, as well as to other related Web resources. PubMed is the bibliographic component of the NCBI's Entrez retrieval system.

							The Booleanoperators AND, OR, and NOT must be entered in uppercase letters and are processed left to right. Nesting of search terms is possible by enclosing concepts in parentheses. The terms inside the set of parentheses will be processed as a unit and then incorporated into the overall strategy. Terms may be qualified using PubMed's <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/pmhelp.html#SearchFieldDescriptionsandTags" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Search Field Descriptions and Tags</ext-link>. Each search term should be followed by the appropriate search field tag, which indicates which field will be searched:
						</p>
						<p>
							Search term: o'malley [au] will search only the author field. Specifying the field precludes the Automatic Term Mapping, which would result in the search o'malley[All Fields] if the field were not specified. Similarly, using the search term Cell [Journal] avoids using the MeSH Translation Table, which would interpret Cell as only a text word and MeSH term.

								<title>Simple Searching</title>
								<p>
									A simple search can be conducted from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PubMed</ext-link>
									homepage by entering terms in the query box and pressing Enter from the keyboard or clicking on the  Go button on the screen.
								</p>
								<p>
									If more than one term is entered in the query box, PubMed will go through the Automatic Term Mapping protocol described in the previous section, first looking for all the terms, as typed, to find an exact match. If the exact phrase is not found, PubMed clips a term off the end and repeats Automatic Term Mapping, again looking for an exact match, but this time to the abbreviated query. This continues until none of the words are found in any one of the translation tables. In this case, PubMed combines terms (with the AND Boolean operator) and applies the Automatic Term Mapping process to each individual word. PubMed ignores 
									<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/pmhelp.html#Stopwords" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Stopwords</ext-link>
									, such as about, of, or what. People can also apply their own Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to multiple search terms; the Boolean operators must be in uppercase.
								</p>
								<boxed-text content-type="website" position="anchor">
									<title>Search term: vitamin c common cold</title>
									<p>
										Translated as: ((ascorbic acid [MeSH Terms] OR vitamin c [Text Word]) AND (common cold [MeSH Terms] OR common cold [Text Word]))
									</p>
								</boxed-text>
								<boxed-text content-type="website" position="anchor">
									<title>Search term: single cell separation brain</title>
									<p>
										Translated as: (((single person [MeSH Terms] OR single [Text Word]) AND (cell separation [MeSH Terms] OR cell separation [Text Word])) AND (brain [MeSH Terms] OR brain [Text Word]))
									</p>
								</boxed-text>
								<p>
									If a phrase of more than two terms is not found in any translation table, then the last word of the phrase is dropped, and the remainder of the phrase is sent through the entire process again. This continues, removing one word at a time, until a match is found.
								</p>
								<p>
									If there is no match found during the Automatic Term Mapping process, the individual terms will be combined with AND and searched in All Fields.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							The resources provided by NCBI for studying the three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins center around two databases: the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), which provides structural information about individual proteins; and the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), which provides a directory of sequence and structure alignments representing conserved functional domains within proteins(CDs). Together, these two databases allow scientists to retrieve and view structures, find structurally similar proteins to a protein of interest, and identify conserved functional sites.
						</p>
						<p>
							To enable scientists to accomplish these tasks, NCBI has integrated MMDB and CDD into the Entrez retrieval system (Chapter 15). In addition, structures can be found by BLAST, because sequences derived from MMDB structures have been included in the BLAST databases (Chapter 16). Once a protein structure has been identified, the domains within the protein, as well as domain neighbors (i.e., those with similar structure) can be found. For novel data not yet included in Entrez, there are separate search services available.
						</p>
						<p>
							Protein structures can be visualized using Cn3D, an interactive 3D graphic modeling tool. Details of the structure, such as ligand-binding sites, can be scrutinized and highlighted. Cn3D can also display multiple sequence alignments based on sequence and/or structural similarity among related sequences, 3D domains, or members of a CDD family. Cn3D images and alignments can be manipulated easily and exported to other applications for presentation or further analysis.

								<title>Accession numbers.</title>
								<p>
									MMDB records have several types of Accession numbers associated with them, representing the following data types:

									<list list-type="bullet">
										<list-item id="bid.100">
											<p>
												Each MMDB record has at least three Accession numbers: the PDB code of the corresponding PDB record (e.g., 1CYO, 1B8G); a unique MMDB-ID (e.g., 645, 12342); and a gi number for each protein chain. A new MMDB-ID is assigned whenever PDB updates either the sequence or coordinates of a structure record, even if the PDB code is retained.
											</p>
										</list-item>
										<list-item id="bid.1635">
											<p>
												If an MMDB record contains more than one polypeptide or nucleotide chain, each chain in the MMDB record is assigned an Accession number in Entrez Protein or Nucleotide consisting of the PDB code followed by the letter designating that chain (e.g., 1B8GA, 3TATB, 1MUHB).
											</p>
										</list-item>
										<list-item id="bid.101">
											<p>
												Each 3D Domain identified in an MMDB record is assigned 
												a unique integer identifier that is appended to the Accession number of the chain to which it belongs (e.g., 1B8G A 2). This new Accession number becomes its identifier in Entrez 3D Domains. New 3D Domain identifiers are assigned whenever a new MMDB-ID is assigned.
											</p>
										</list-item>
										<list-item id="bid.102">
											<p>
												For conserved domains, the Accession number is based on

							</boxed-text>
							<p>
								To build MMDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.236">1</xref>), 3D structure data are retrieved from the PDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.241">6</xref>) administered by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1391">RCSB</xref>). In all cases, the structures in MMDB have been determined by experimental methods, primarily X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1359">NMR</xref>) spectroscopy. Theoretical structure models are omitted. The data in each record are then checked for agreement between the atomic coordinates and the primary sequence, and the sequence data are then extracted from the coordinate set. The resulting agreement between sequence and structure allows the record to be linked efficiently into searches and alignment displays involving other NCBI databases.
							</p>
							<p>
								The data are converted into <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.242">7</xref>), which can be parsed easily and can also accept numerous annotations to the structure data. In contrast to a PDB record, a MMDB record in ASN.1 contains all necessary bonding information in addition to sequence information, allowing consistent display of the 3D structure using Cn3D. The annotations provided in the PDB record by the submitting authors are added, along with uniformly defined secondary structure and domain features. These features support structure-based similarity searches using VAST. Finally, two coordinate subsets are added to the record: one containing only backbone atoms, and one representing a single-conformer model in cases where multiple conformations or structures were present in the PDB record. Both of these additions further simplify viewing both an individual structure and its alignments with structure neighbors in Cn3D. When this process is complete, the record is assigned a unique Accession number, the MMDB-ID (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.99">Box 1</xref>), while also retaining the original four-character PDB code.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.103">
							<title>Annotation of 3D Domains</title>
							<p>
								After initial processing, 3D domains are automatically identified within each MMDB record. 3D domains are annotations on individual MMDB structures that define the boundaries of compact substructures contained within them. In this way, they are similar to secondary structure annotations that define the boundaries of helical or beta-strand substructures. Because proteins are often similar at the level of domains, VAST compares each 3D domain to every other one and to complete polypeptide chains. The results are stored in Entrez as a <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Related 3D Domain</named-content> link.
							</p>
							<p>
								To identify 3D domains within a polypeptide chain, MMDB's domain parser searches for one or more breakpoints in the structure. These breakpoints fall between major secondary structure elements such that the ratio of intra- to interdomain contacts remains above a set threshold. The 3D domains identified in this way provide a means to both increase the sensitivity of structure neighbor calculations and also present 3D superpositions based on compact domains as well as on complete polypeptide chains. They are not intended to represent domains identified by comparative sequence and structure analysis, nor do they represent modules that recur in related proteins, although there is often good agreement between domain boundaries identified by these methods.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.104">
							<title>Links to Other NCBI Resources</title>
							<p>
								After initially processing the PDB record, structure staff add a number of links and other information that further integrate the MMDB record with other NCBI resources. To begin, the sequence information extracted from the PDB record is entered into the Entrez Protein and/or Nucleotide databases as appropriate, providing a means to retrieve the structure information from sequence searches. As with all sequences in Entrez, precomputed BLAST searches are then performed on these sequences, linking them to other molecules of similar sequence. For proteins, these BLAST neighbors may be different than those determined by VAST; whereas VAST uses a conservative significance threshold, the structural similarities it detects often represent remote relationships not detectable by sequence comparison. The literature citations in the PDB record are linked to PubMed so that Entrez searches can allow access to the original descriptions of the structure determinations. Finally, semiautomatic processing of the source field of the PDB record provides links to the NCBI Taxonomy database. Although these links normally follow the genus and species information given, in some cases this information is either absent in the PDB record or refers only to how a sample was obtained. In these cases, the staff manually enters the appropriate taxonomy links.

							<title>The MMDB Record</title>
							<p>
								The Structure Summary page for each MMDB record summarizes the database content for that record and serves as a starting point for analyzing the record using the NCBI structure tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.106">Figure 2</xref>).

									<caption>
										<title>The Structure Summary page.</title>
										<p>
											The page consists of three parts: the header, the view bar, and the graphic display. The header contains basic identifying information about the record: a description of the protein (<italic>Description:</italic>), the author list (<italic>Deposition:</italic>), the species of origin (<italic>Taxonomy:</italic>), literature references (<italic>Reference:</italic>), the MMDB-ID (<italic>MMDB:</italic>), and the PDB code (<italic>PDB:</italic>). Several of these data serve as links to additional information. For example, the species name links to the Taxonomy browser, the literature references link to PubMed, and the PDB code links to the PDB Web site. The view bar allows the user to view the structure record either as a graphic with Cn3D or as a text record in either ASN.1, PDB (RasMol), or Mage formats. The latter can also be downloaded directly from this page. The graphic display contains a variety of information and links to related databases: (<italic>a</italic>) The Chain bar. Each chain of the molecule is displayed as a <italic>dark bar</italic> labeled with residue numbers. To the <italic>left</italic> of this bar is a <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Protein</named-content> hyperlink that takes the user to a view of the protein record in Entrez Protein. The bar itself is also a hyperlink and displays the VAST neighbors of the chain. If a structure contains nucleotide sequences, they are displayed in the order contained in the PDB record. A <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Nucleotide</named-content> hyperlink to their <italic>left</italic> takes the user to the appropriate record in Entrez Nucleotide. (<italic>b</italic>) The VAST (3D) Domain bar. The <italic>colored bars</italic> immediately below the Chain bar indicate the locations of structural domains found by the original MMDB processing of the protein. In many cases, such a domain contains unconnected sections of the protein sequence, and in such cases, discontinuous pieces making up the domain will have bars of the same color. To the <italic>left</italic> of the Domain bar is a 3D Domains hyperlink (<italic>3d Domains</italic>) that launches the 3D Domains browser in Entrez, where the user can find information about each constituent domain. Selecting a colored segment displays the VAST Structure Neighbors page for that domain. (<italic>c</italic>) The CD bar. Below the VAST Domain bar are <italic>rounded, rectangular bars</italic> representing conserved domains found by a CD-Search. The bars identify the best scoring hits; overlapping hits are shown only if the mutual overlap with hits having better scores is less than 50%. The <italic>CDs</italic> hyperlink to the <italic>left</italic> of the bar displays the CD records in Entrez Domains. Each of the colored bars is also a hyperlink that displays the corresponding CD Summary page configured to show the multiple alignment of the protein sequence with members of the selected CD.

This bar allows the user to find specific structural neighbors by entering their PDB or MMDB identifiers. (<italic>d</italic>) The <italic>lower portion</italic> of the page displays a graphical alignment of the various matching domains. The <italic>upper three bars</italic> show summary information about the query sequence: the <italic>top bar</italic> shows the maximum extent of alignment found on all the sequences displayed on the current page (users should note that the appearance of this bar, therefore, depends on which hits are displayed); the <italic>middle bar</italic> represents the query sequence itself that served as input for the VAST search; and the <italic>lower bar</italic> shows any matching CDs and is identical to the CD bar on the Structure Summary page. Listed below these three summary bars are the hits from the VAST search, sorted according to the selection in the nr-PDB bar. Aligned regions are shown in <italic>red</italic>, with gaps indicating unaligned regions. To the <italic>left</italic> of each domain accession is a check box that can be used to select any combination of domains to be displayed either on this page or using Cn3D. Moreover, each of the bars in the display is itself a link, and placing the mouse pointer over any bar reveals both the extent of the alignment by residue number and the data linked to the bar.

The chains are then clustered into groups of similar sequence using a single-linkage clustering procedure. Chains within a sequence-similar group are automatically ranked according to the quality of their structural data.

						<title>Content of the Conserved Domain Database (CDD)</title>
						<sec id="bid.111">
							<title>What Is a Conserved Domain (CD)?</title>
							<p>
								CDs are recurring units in polypeptide chains (sequence and structure motifs), the extents of which can be determined by comparative analysis. Molecular evolution uses such domains as building blocks and these may be recombined in different arrangements to make different proteins with different functions. The CDD contains sequence alignments that define the features that are conserved within each domain family. Therefore, the CDD serves as a classification resource that groups proteins based on the presence of these predefined domains. CDD entries often name the domain family and describe the role of conserved residues in binding or catalysis. Conserved domains are displayed in MMDB Structure summaries and link to a sequence alignment showing other proteins in which the domain is conserved, which may provide clues on protein function.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.112">
							<title>Sources of Primary Data</title>
							<p>
								The collections of domain alignments in the CDD are imported either from two databases outside of the NCBI, named Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.243">8</xref>) and SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.244">9</xref>); from the NCBI COB database; from another NCBI collection named LOAD; and from a database curated by the CDD staff. The first task is to identify the underlying sequences in each collection and then link these sequences to the corresponding ones in Entrez. If the CDD staff cannot find the Accession numbers for the sequences in the records from the source databases, they locate appropriate sequences using BLAST. Particular attention is paid to any resulting match that is linked to a structure record in MMDB, and the staff substitute alignment rows with such sequences whenever possible. After the staff imports a collection, they then choose a sequence that best represents the family. Whenever possible, the staff chooses a representative that has a structure record in MMDB.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.113">
							<title>The Position-specific Score Matrix (PSSM)</title>
							<p>
								Once imported and constructed, each domain alignment in CDD is used to calculate a model sequence, called a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1266">consensus sequence</xref>, for each CD. The consensus sequence lists the most frequently found residue in each position in the alignment; however, for a sequence position to be included in the consensus sequence, it must be present in at least 50% of the aligned sequences. Aligned columns covered by the consensus sequence are then used to calculate a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1386">PSSM</xref>, which memorizes the degree to which particular residues are conserved at each position in the sequence. Once calculated, the PSSM is stored with the alignment and becomes part of the CDD. The <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1396">RPS-BLAST</xref> tool locates CDs within a query sequence by searching against this database of PSSMs.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.114">
							<title>Reverse Position-specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST)</title>
							<p>
								RPS-BLAST (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>) is a variant of the popular Position-specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program. PSI-BLAST finds sequences similar to the query and uses the resulting alignments to build a PSSM for the query. With this PSSM the database is scanned again to draw in more hits and further refine the scoring model. RPS-BLAST uses a query sequence to search a database of precalculated PSSMs and report significant hits in a single pass. The role of the PSSM has changed from query to subject; hence, the term reverse in RPS-BLAST. RPS-BLAST is the search tool used in the CD-Search service.

								Analogous to the Structure Summary page, the CD Summary page displays the available information about a given CD and offers various links for either viewing the CD alignment or initiating further searches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.116">Figure 4</xref>).

							<title>CD Records Curated at NCBI</title>
							<p>
								In 2002, NCBI released the first group of curated CD records, a new and expanding set of annotated protein multiple sequence alignments and corresponding  structure alignments. These new records have Accession numbers beginning with  cd and have been added to the default CD-Search database. Most curated CD records are based on existing family descriptions from SMART and Pfam, but the alignments may have been revised extensively by quantitatively using three-dimensional structures and by re-examining the domain extent. In addition, CDD curators annotate conserved functional residues, ligands, and co-factors contained within the structures. They also record evidence for these sites as pointers to relevant literature or to three-dimensional structures exemplifying their properties. These annotations may be viewed using Cn3D and thus provide a direct way of visualizing functional properties of a protein domain in the context  of its three-dimensional structure.

							<title>The Distinction between 3D Domains and CDs</title>
							<p>
								The term domain refers in general to a distinct functional and/or structural unit of a protein. Each polypeptide chain in MMDB is analyzed for the presence of two classes of domains, and it is important for users to understand the difference between them. One class, called 3D Domains, is based solely on similar, compact substructures, whereas the second class, called Conserved Domains (CDs), is based solely on conserved sequence motifs. These two classifications often agree, because the compact substructures within a protein often correspond to domains joined by recombination in the evolutionary history of a protein. Note that CD links can be identified even when no 3D structures within a family are known. Moreover, 3D Domain links may also indicate relationships either to structures not included in CDD entries or to structures so distantly related that no significant similarity can be found by sequence comparisons.

								<title>Finding the Structure of a Protein</title>
								<p>
									Suppose that we are interested in the biosynthesis of aminocyclopropanes and would like to find structural information on important active site residues in any available aminocyclopropane synthases. To begin, we would go to the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Structure</named-content> main page and enter aminocyclopropane synthase in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> box. Pressing Enter displays a short list of structures, one of which is 1B8G, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase. Perhaps we would like to know the species from which this protein was derived. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Taxonomy</named-content> link to the right shows that this protein was derived from <italic>Malux x domestica</italic>, or the common apple tree. Going back to the Entrez results page and selecting the PDB code (1B8G) opens the Structure Summary page for this record. The species is again displayed on this page, along with a link to the <italic>Journal of Molecular Biology</italic> article describing how the structure was determined. We immediately see from this page that this protein appears as a dimer in the structure, with each chain having three 3D domains, as identified by VAST. In addition, CD-Search has identified an aminotran_1_2 CD in each chain. Now we are ready to view the 3D structure.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.121">
								<title>Viewing the 3D Structure</title>
								<p>
									Once we have found the Structure Summary page, viewing the 3D structure is straightforward. To view the structure in Cn3D, we simply select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">View 3D Structure</named-content> button. The default view is to show helices in green, strands in brown, and loops in blue. This color scheme is also reflected in the Sequence/Alignment Viewer.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.122">
								<title>Locating an Active Site</title>
								<p>
									Upon inspecting the structure, we immediately notice that a small molecule is bound to the protein, likely at the active site of the enzyme. How do we find out what that molecule is? One easy way is to return to the Structure Summary page and select the link to the PDB code, which takes us to the PDB Structure Explorer page for 1B8G. Quickly, we see that pyridoxal-5 prime-phosphate (PLP) is a HET group, or heterogen, in the structure. Our interest piqued, we would now like to know more about the structural domain containing the active site. Returning to Cn3D, we manipulate the structure so that PLP is easily visible and then use the mouse to double-click on any PLP atom. The molecule becomes selected and turns yellow. Now from the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show/Hide</named-content> menu, we choose <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Select by distance</named-content> and <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Residues only</named-content> and enter 5 Angstroms for a search radius. Scanning the Sequence/Alignment Viewer, we see that seven residues are now highlighted: 117-119, 230, 268, 270, and 279. Glancing at the 3D Domain display in the Structure Summary page, we note that all of these residues lie in domain 3. We now focus our attention on this domain.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.123">
								<title>Viewing Structure Neighbors of a 3D Domain</title>
								<p>
									Given that this enzyme is a dimer, we arbitrarily choose domain 3 in chain A, the accession of which is thus 1B8GA3. By clicking on the 3D Domain bar at a point within domain 3, we are taken to the VAST Structure Neighbors page for this domain, where we find nearly 200 structure neighbors.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.124">
								<title>Restricting the Search by Taxonomy</title>
								<p>
									Perhaps we would now like to identify some of the most evolutionarily distant structure neighbors of domain 1B8GA3 as a means of finding conserved residues that may be associated with its binding and/or catalytic function. One powerful way of doing this is to choose structure neighbors from phylogenetically distant organisms. We therefore need to combine our present search with a Taxonomy search. Given that 1B8G is derived from the superkingdom Eukaryota, we would like to find structure neighbors in other superkingdom taxa, such as Eubacteria and Archaea. Returning to the Structure Summary page, select the 3D Domains link in the graphic display to open the list of 3D Domains in Entrez. Finding 1B8GA3 in the list, selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Related 3D Domains</named-content> link shows a list of all the structure neighbors of this domain. From this page, we select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Preview/Index</named-content>, which shows our recent queries. Suppose our set of related 3D Domains is #5. We then perform two searches:
									<preformat>
										1. #5 AND Archaea[Organism]
										2. #5 AND Eubacteria[Organism]
									</preformat>

								</p>
								<p>
									Looking at the Archaea results, we find among them 1DJUA3, a domain from an aromatic aminotransferase from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic>. Concerning the Eubacteria results, we find among the several hundred matching domains 3TATA2, a tyrosine aminotransferase from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.125">
								<title>Viewing a 3D Superposition of Active Sites</title>
								<p>
									Returning to the VAST Structure Neighbors page for 1B8GA3, we want to select 1DJUA3 and 3TATA2 to display in a structural alignment. One way to do this is to enter these two Accession numbers in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Find</named-content> box and press <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Find</named-content>. We now see only these two neighbors, and we can select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">View 3D Structure</named-content> to launch Cn3D.
								</p>
								<p>
									Cn3D again displays the aligned residues in red, and we can highlight these further by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show aligned residues</named-content> from the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show/Hide</named-content> menu. The excellent agreement between both the active site structures and the conformations of the bound ligands is readily apparent. Furthermore, by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Style/Coloring Shortcuts/Sequence Conservation/Variety</named-content>, we can easily see that the most highly conserved residues are concentrated near the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.126">Figure 6</xref>).

									The first step to any structural analysis at NCBI is to find the structure records for the protein of interest or for proteins similar to it. One may search MMDB directly by entering search terms such as PDB code, protein name, author, or journal in the Entrez Structure <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> box on the Structure <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure">homepage</ext-link>. Alternative points of entry are shown below.
								</p>
								<p>
									By using the full array of Entrez search tools, the resulting list of MMDB records can be honed, ideally, to a workable list from which a record can be selected. Users should note that multiple records may exist for a given protein, reflecting different experimental techniques, conditions, and the presence or absence of various ligands or metal ions. Records may also contain different fragments of the full-length molecule. In addition, many structures of mutant proteins are also available. The PDB record for a given structure generally contains some description of the experimental conditions under which the structure was determined, and this file can be accessed by selecting the PDB code link at the top of the Structure Summary page.

Once the structure is loaded, a user can manipulate and annotate it using an array of options as described in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3dtut.shtml">Cn3D Tutorial</ext-link>. By default, Cn3D colors the structure according to the secondary structure elements. However, another useful view is to color the protein by domain (see <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Style</named-content> menu options), using the same color scheme as is shown in the graphic display on the Structure Summary page. These color changes also affect the residues displayed in the Sequence/Alignment Viewer, allowing the identification of domain or secondary structure elements in the primary sequence. In addition to Cn3D, users can also display 3D structures with RasMol or Mage. Structures can also be saved locally as an ASN.1, PDB, or Mage file (depending on the choice of structure viewer) for later display.

								<title>Finding CDs in a Protein</title>
								<p>
									Suppose that we are interested in topoisomerase enzymes and would like to find human topoisomerases that most closely resemble those found in eubacteria and thus may share a common ancestor. Further suppose that through a colleague, we are aware of a recent and particularly interesting crystal structure of a topoisomerase from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with PDB code 1I7D. How can we identify the conserved functional domains in this protein and then find human proteins with the same domains? From the Structure main page, we enter the PDB code 1I7D in the Structure <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Summary</named-content> search box and quickly find the Structure Summary page for this record. We see that in this crystal structure, the protein is complexed with a single-stranded oligonucleotide. We also see that the protein has five 3D Domains. Two CDs align to the sequence as well, and they overlap with one another at the N-terminus of the protein in the region corresponding to the first 3D domain.
								</p>

							<sec id="bid.181">
								<title>Analyzing CDs Found in a Protein</title>
								<p>
									The Struture summary page displays only the CDs that give the best match to the protein sequence. To see all of the matching CDs, we can easily perform a full CD-Search. Select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Protein</named-content> link to the left of the graphic to reveal the flatfile for the record. Then follow the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Domains</named-content> link in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Link</named-content> menu on the right to view the results of the CD-Search. Select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show Details</named-content> to see all CDs matching the query sequence. We find that nine CDs match this sequence, and that the statistics of each match are shown below the alignment graphic. The CD with the best hit is TopA from the COG database, and it is further clear that this domain consists of two smaller domains: TOPRIM (alignments from Pfam, SMART, and curated CD) and a topoisomerase domain (alignments from Pfam and curated CD). We can learn more about these CDs by studying the pairwise alignments at the bottom of the page and by studying their CD Summary pages, reached by selecting the links to their left.

We can execute this taxonomic restriction by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Go back</named-content>, and we now find a much shorter list of CDART results. In the most similar group, we find two members, one of which is NP_004609. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">more&gt;</named-content> link for this record shows the CD-Search results for this human protein. Interestingly, we find that the topoisomerase is very well conserved, whereas only a portion of the TOPRIM domain has been retained.

								<title>Viewing a CD Alignment with a 3D Structure</title>
								<p>
									We now would like to view the alignment of the topoisomerase in the human protein to other members of this CD. On the CD-Search page, select the colored bar of this CD to see a CD-Browser window displaying the alignment. Because this is a curated CD record, we are able to view functional features of the protein domain on a structural template. The rightmost menu in the View Alignment bar shows the available features for this domain, whereas the topmost row in the alignment itself marks the residues involved in this feature with # symbols. The second row of the alignment is the consensus sequence of the CD record, whereas the third row contains the NP_004609 sequence, labeled query. At the bottom of the page, buttons allow Cn3D to be launched with various structural features highlighted. For example, if we are interested in nucleotide binding site II, Cn3D will launch with the view depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.184">Figure 7</xref>, showing the bound nucleotide in orange. Additonal Cn3D windows not shown in Figure 7 allow one to highlight the binding site residues yellow as shown, and these highlights also appear in the sequence window. In this figure, the NP_004609 sequence has been merged into the alignment (bottom row) using tools within Cn3D, and the result shows that this human protein closely conserves these important functional residues.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							Sequence variations exist at defined positions within genomes and are responsible for individual  phenotypic characteristics, including a person's propensity toward complex disorders such as heart disease and cancer. As  tools for understanding human variation and molecular genetics, sequence variations can be used for gene mapping, definition  of population structure, and performance of functional studies.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) is a public-domain archive for a broad collection of  simple genetic polymorphisms. This collection of polymorphisms includes  single-base nucleotide substitutions (also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), small-scale multi-base  deletions or insertions (also called deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPs), and retroposable element insertions and  microsatellite repeat variations (also called short tandem repeats or STRs). Please note that in this chapter, you can  substitute any class of variation for the term SNP. Each dbSNP entry includes the sequence context of the polymorphism (i.e.,  the surrounding sequence), the occurrence frequency of the polymorphism (by population or individual), and the experimental  method(s), protocols, and conditions used to assay the variation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The dbSNP accepts submissions for variations in any species and from any part of a genome. This document  will provide you with options for finding SNPs in dbSNP, discuss dbSNP content and organization, and furnish instructions to  help you create your own (local) copy of dbSNP.

					<lesson  id="lesson1144">
						<title>Introduction</title>
						<p>
							The dbSNPhas been designed to support submissions  and research into a broad range of biological problems. These include physical mapping, functional analysis and  pharmacogenomics, association studies, and evolutionary studies. Because <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbSNP</ext-link>was developed to complement GenBank, it may contain nucleotide sequences (Figure 1)  from any organism; currently, the majority of the data is for human and mouse.

									<title>The structure of the flanking sequence.</title>
									<p>
										The structure of the flanking sequence in dbSNP is a composite of bases  either assayed for variation or included from published sequence. We make the distinction to distinguish regions of sequence  that have been experimentally surveyed for variation ( <italic>assay</italic>) from those regions that have not been surveyed  ( <italic>flank</italic>). The minimum sequence length for a variation definition (SNPassay) is 25 bp for both the 5 and  3 flanks and 100 bp overall to ensure an adequate sequence for accurate mapping of the variation on reference genome  sequence. ( <italic>a</italic>) Flanking sequence completely surveyed for variation. Both 5 and 3 flanking  sequence can be defined with 5_assay and 3_assay fields, respectively, when all flanking sequence was examined  for variation. This can occur in both experimental contexts (e.g., denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography or DNA  sequencing) and computational contexts (e.g., analysis of BACoverlap  sequence). ( <italic>b</italic>) Partial survey of flanking sequence can occur when detection methods examine only a region of  sequence surrounding the variation that is shorter than either the 25 bp per flank rule or the 100 bp overall length rule. In  these experimental designs (e.g., chip hybridization, enzymatic cleavage), we designate the experimental sequence  5_assay or 3_assay, and you can insert published sequence (usually from a gene reference sequence) as  5_flank or 3_flank to construct a sequence definition that will satisfy the length rules. ( <italic>c</italic>)  Unknown or no survey of flanking sequence can occur when variations are captured from published literature without an  indication of survey conditions. In these cases, the entire flanking sequence is defined as 5_flank and  3_flank.

							<title>Physical Mapping</title>
							<p>
								In the physical mapping of nucleotide sequences, variations are used as positional markers. When mapped to  a unique location in a genome, variation markers work with the same logic as Sequence Tagged Sites  (  STSs) or framework   microsatellitemarkers. As is the case for STSs, the position of a variation is defined by its unique flanking sequence, and hence,  variations can serve as stable landmarks in the genome, even if the variation is fixed for one   allelein a sample. When multiple alleles are observed in a sample pedigree, pedigree members can  be tested for variation   genotypes as in traditional physical mapping  studies.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1647">
							<title>Functional Analysis</title>
							<p>
								Variations that occur in functional regions of genes or in conserved non-coding regions can cause  significant changes in the complement of transcribed sequences, leading to changes in protein expression that can affect  aspects of the   phenotypesuch as metabolism or cell signaling. We note  possible functional implications of DNA sequence variations in dbSNP in terms of how the variation alters mRNA  transcripts.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1648">
							<title>Association Studies</title>
							<p>
								The associations between variations and complex genetic traits are more ambiguous than simple, single-gene  mutations that lead to a phenotypic change. When multiple genes are involved in a trait, then the identification of the  genetic causes of the trait requires the identification of the chromosomal segment combinations, or haplotypes, that carry  the putative gene variants.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1649">
							<title>Evolutionary Studies</title>
							<p>
								The variations in dbSNP currently represent an uneven but large sampling of genome diversity. The human  data in dbSNP include submissions from the SNP Consortium, variations mined from genome sequence as part of the human genome  project, and individual lab contributions of variations in specific genes, mRNAs,   ESTs, or genomic regions.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1650">
							<title>Null Results Are Important</title>
							<p>
								Systematic surveys of sequence variation will undoubtedly reveal sequences that are invariant in the  sample. These observations can be submitted to dbSNP as NoVariation records that record the sequence, the population, and the  sample size that were used in the survey.

							<p>
								The essential component of a submission to dbSNP is the nucleotide sequence itself. dbSNP accepts  submissions as either genomic DNA or cDNA (i.e., sequenced mRNA transcript) sequence. Sequence submissions have a minimum  length requirement to maximize the specificity of the sequence in larger contexts, such as a reference genome sequence. We  also structure submissions so that the user can distinguish regions of sequence actually surveyed for variation from regions  of sequence that are cut and pasted from a published reference sequence to satisfy the minimum-length requirements.   Figure 1shows the details of flanking sequence structure.

The submitter  provides all other details of the techniques in a free-text description of the method.

These broad categories provide a general framework for organizing  the approximately 700 (as of this writing) sample descriptions in dbSNP.

								Alleles typically exist at different frequencies in different populations; a very common allele in  one population may be quite rare in another population. Also, allelic variants can emerge as   private polymorphismswhen particular populations have been reproductively isolated from  neighboring groups, as is the case with religious isolates or island populations. Frequency data are submitted to dbSNP as  allele counts or binned frequency intervals, depending on the precision of the experimental method used to make the  measurement. dbSNP contains records of allele frequencies for specific population samples defined by each submitter  (  Table 4).

									<title>The refSNP Clustering Process</title>
									<p>
										Submitters can arbitrarily define variations on either strand of DNA sequence; therefore,  submissions in a refSNP cluster can be reported on the forward or reverse strand. The orientation of the refSNP and, hence,  its sequence and allele string, is set by a cluster exemplar. By convention, the clustering process (Figure 6) picks a cluster exemplar as that member of a cluster with the longest sequence. In subsequent  builds, this sequence may be in reverse orientation to the current orientation of the refSNP. When this occurs, we try to  preserve the orientation of the refSNP, if possible, by using the reverse complement of the cluster exemplar to set the  orientation of the refSNP sequence. 
										<fig id="bid.1181">

												<title>The dbSNP reclustering process.</title>
												<p>
													We define clusters on shared locations (refSNPs) when we BLAST all  existing refSNPs against contig sequence. In cases where contig sequence is not available or the variation is defined in a  mRNA flanking sequence that will not map to a contig, we compute the refSNP set based on hits to the RefSeq or GenBank  sequences for the organism. We rank map hits as either LO or HI quality and parse the hits to assign a weightto each refSNP. We make the set of all hits unique by dropping contig location  and retaining only the first occurrence of each rs#, ss#, ID, and the cluster in which each ID number appears. The resulting  data include all refSNPs for the current build that have at least one hit to contig, RefSeq, or GenBank sequence. We then  compare the set of new submissions that fail to hit these sequence sets against each other using BLAST. This removes any  potential redundancy in the incoming data, and unmapped refSNPs are instantiated for these data as well. This final merged  set of data constitutes the refSNP set for the current build.

								<sec id="bid.1182">
									<title>Summary Measures of Variation</title>
									<p>
										The best single measure of a variation's diversity in different populations is its average heterozygosity. This measure serves as the general probability that both  alleles are in a diploid individual or in a sample of two chromosomes. Estimates of average heterozygosity have an  accompanying standard error based on the sample sizes of the underlying data, which reflects the overall uncertainty of the  estimate.
									</p>
									<p>
										Additional summary measures of variation include counts of populations and individuals  sampled for this variation.

								</sec>

							<sec id="bid.1183">
								<title>Mapping to Reference Genome Sequence</title>
								<p>
									When reference genome assemblies are available, we use them as anchor sequence to place refSNP  clusters into a genomic context. We clean dbSNP flanking sequence with   RepeatMaskerand then re-map them to the most current build of each genome using MegaBLAST. The  mapping results then define a new non-redundant set of variations for the genome.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1184">
								<title>Reclustering</title>
								<p>
									We define a refSNP operationally as a variation at a location on an ideal reference chromosome.  Such reference chromosomes are the goal of genome assemblies. However, work is still in progress in cases such as the human  genome project; therefore, we must currently define a refSNP as a variation in the interim reference contig sequence. Every  time there is a genomic assembly update, the interim reference contig sequence changes, and refSNPs must be updated or  reclustered.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reclustering process begins when NCBI updates the genomic assembly. We BLAST all existing  refSNPs as well as any newly submitted SNPs (not yet bound to a refSNP cluster) against the genome assembly. Then, we cluster  SNPs that co-locate at the same place on the genome into a single refSNP. Usually, new clusters are composed entirely of new  submitted SNPs, or else the newly submitted SNPs cluster to an already existing refSNP. When newly submitted SNPs cluster  among themselves, they are assigned to a new refSNP ID#, and when they cluster with an already existing refSNP, they are  assigned to the cluster for that refSNP.
								</p>
								<p>
									Sometimes a refSNP will co-locate with another existing refSNP. In this case, the refSNP with a  higher ID number is retired, and all the submitted SNPs in its cluster are reassigned to the refSNP with the lower ID  number.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once the clusters are formed, the variation of a refSNP is the union of all possible alleles  defined in the set of submitted SNPs that composed the cluster.   Figure 6is a  detailed flow chart of the reclustering process.

							<sec id="bid.1185">
								<title>NCBI Contig Annotation</title>
								<p>
									We annotate   weight1 and 2 refSNP variations  on NCBI RefSeq chromosomes, contig sequences, mRNAs, and proteins as variation features with multiple allele qualifiers (one  per allele). Weight 2 records receive an additional warning note to indicate the ambiguous nature of the mapping result.
								</p>
								<boxed-text content-type="website" position="anchor">
									<title>Hint:</title>
									<p>
										The two hits that define a weight 2 variation may not reflect paralogyin the genome. Sequence assemblies are imperfect, and some regions of unique genome  sequence are potentially reflected in two or more contig sequence fragments. Because we are currently unable to distinguish  such cases from true paralogy, we annotate the variation in both locations with a warning and leave the assessment of the  flanking sequence to the user.
									</p>
								</boxed-text>
								<p>
									We do not believe that weight 3 and weight 10 variations have sufficient utility to warrant their  annotation, but the mapping results for these variations are still available in dbSNP.
								</p>
								<p>
									We annotate NoVariation records on NCBI RefSeq chromosomes, contig sequences, mRNAs, and proteins  as a miscellaneous feature, or misc_feat. All dbSNP annotations also include a db_Xref cross-reference pointer back to dbSNP  that uses the refSNP ID number.

							<sec id="bid.1186">
								<title>Annotating GenBank and Other RefSeq Records</title>
								<p>
									GenBank records can be annotated only by their original authors. Therefore, when we find  high-quality hits of refSNP records to the   HTGSand non-redundant  divisions of GenBank, we connect them using LinkOut (  Chapter 17).
								</p>
								<p>
									We annotate RefSeq mRNAs with variation features when the refSNP has a high-quality hit to the  mRNA sequence. If the variation is in the coding region of the transcript and has a non-synonymous allele that changes the  protein sequence, we also annotate the variation on the protein translation of the mRNA. The alleles in protein annotations  are the amino acid translations of the affected codons.

								<title>NCBI Map Viewer Variation and Linkage Maps</title>
								<p>
									The Map Viewer (  Chapter 20) can show multiple  maps of sequence features in common chromosome coordinates. The variation map shows all variation features that we annotate  on the current genome assembly. There are two ways to see the variation data. The default graphic mode shows the data as tick  marks on the vertical coordinate scale. When    variation is selected as the master map, a summary of map quality,  quality warning, functional relationships to genes, average heterozygosity with standard error, and validation information  are provided. If genotype, haplotype, or LinkOut data are available, the master map will also contain links to this  information.

								<p>Table 5defines variation functional  classes. We base class on the relationship between a variation and any local gene features. When a variation is near a  transcript or in a transcript interval but not in the coding region, then we define the functional class by the position of  the variation relative to the structure of the aligned transcript. In other words, a variation may be near a gene  ( locusregion), in a UTR(mrna-utr), in an intron(intron), or in a  splice site (splice site). If the variation is in a coding region, then the functional class of the variation depends on how  each allele may affect the translated peptide sequence.

In some cases, one allele will be a  synonymous change, and the other allele will be a nonsynonymous change. If any allele is a nonsynonymous change, then the  variation is classified as a nonsynonymous variation. Otherwise, the variation is classified as a synonymous variation.

								<p>
									When a SNP results in amino acid sequence change, knowing where that amino acid lies in  the protein structure is valuable. We provide this information using the following procedure. To find the location of a SNP  within a particular protein, we attempt to identify similar proteins whose structure is known by comparing the protein  sequence against proteins from the PDBdatabase of known protein  structures using BLAST. Then, if we find matches, we use the BLAST alignment to identify the amino acid in the protein of  known structure that corresponds to the amino acid containing the SNP. We store the position of the amino acid on the 3D  structure that corresponds to the amino acid containing the SNP in the dbSNP table SNP3D.

									There are two methods by which we localize variations to known genes: ( <italic>a</italic>)  if a variation is mapped to the genome, we note the variation/gene relationship ( Table  5) during functional classification and store the locus_id of the gene in the dbSNP table SNPContigLocusId; and  ( <italic>b</italic>) if the variation does not map to the genome, we look for high-quality blast hits for the variation against  mRNA sequence. We note these hits with the protein_ID (PID) of the protein (the conceptual translation of the mRNA  transcript). LocusLink scans this table nightly and updates the table MapLinkPID with the locus_id for the gene when the  protein is a known product of a gene.

								<title>UniSTS</title>
								<p>
									When an original submitted SNP record shows a relationship between a SNP and a STS, we  share the data with dbSTS and establish a link between the SNP and the STS record. We also examine refSNPs for proximity to  STS features during contig annotation. When we determine that a variation needs to be placed within an STS feature, we note  the relationship in the dbSNP table SnpInSts.

						<title>How to Create a Local Copy of dbSNP</title>
						<p>
							dbSNP is a relational database with about 100 tables. NCBI deploys dbSNP in both MSSQL and Sybase  environments, and the public can download the full contents of the database from the dbSNP FTPsite. The following sections will guide you in this process.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1205">
							<title>Schema: The dbSNP Physical Model</title>
							<p>
								A schema is a necessary part of constructing your own copy of dbSNP because it is a visual  representation of dbSNP and shows the logical relationship between data in dbSNP. It is available as a printable PDF   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/Sybase/schema/PDM_dbSNP_work.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">file</ext-link>from the dbSNP FTP site.
							</p>
							<p>
								Data in dbSNP are organized into zones or boxes, depending on the nature of the  data. Each zone is color coded to allow the viewer to find the data more easily. The current color groupings are   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/outreach/gettingstarted/snpftp/sybase.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">available</ext-link>online.  The data dictionary currently includes a description of all the tables in dbSNP, tables of columns and their properties, and  tables of foreign keys in the conceptual model. Foreign keys are not enforced in the physical model because they make it  harder to load table data asynchronously. In the future, we will add descriptions of individual columns. The data dictionary  described above is available in rich text format in the file dbSNPdataDictionary.rtf.gz. The data are also available online  from the dbSNP Web site.

										<bold>Data integrity (creating a partial local copy of dbSNP).</bold>
										dbSNP is a  relational database. Each table has either a unique index or a primary key. Foreign keys are not reinforced. There are  advantages and a disadvantage to this approach. The advantages are: it makes it easy to drop and re-create the table using  dbSNP_table.atx, which makes it possible to create a partial local copy of dbSNP. For example, if you are interested only in  the original submitted SNP and their population frequencies and not in their map locations on NCBI genome contigs or GenBank  Accession numbers (both are huge tables), then these tables can be skipped (i.e., SNPContigLoc and MapLink). Of unit, to  select tables for a particular query, the contents of each table and the dbSNP entity relationship (ER) diagram need to be  understood. The disadvantage of unreinforced references is that either the stored procedures or the external code needs to be  written to ensure the referential integrity.

						<sec id="bid.2002">
							<title>ASN.1 Brief and Full Versions</title>

								The file docsum.asn is the ASN structure definition file for both formats of the data. The 00readme file, located in the /specs subdirectory of the   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbSNP FTP</ext-link>site, includes comments defining the sections common to both the full and the brief formats and the sections included in only the full version. ASN.1 text or binary output can be converted into one or more of the following formats: flatfile, FASTA, docsum, chromosome report, RS/SS, and XML. To do this, request ASN.1 output from either the dbSNP FTP site or the dbSNP batch query pages, and use dstool (located in the bin directory of the dSNP FTP site) to locally convert the output into as many alternative formats as needed.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.2003">
							<title>XML Brief and Full Versions</title>

The file NSE.dtd is simply a header file that bundles the two module files NCBI_Entity and NSE (NCBI SNP Exchange). The real structure definitions for the SNP data are in NSE.mod. This file is a direct conversion of the ASN.1 definition file (docsum.asn) into XML.  All three XML files described above must be included in your download to parse the dbSNP XML data dumps successfully. The 00readme file located in the /specs subdirectory includes comments defining the sections common to both the full and the brief formats and the sections included in only the full version.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.2004">
							<title>FASTA: ss and rs</title>
							<p>
								The FASTA report format provides the flanking sequence for each report of variation in dbSNP, as well as all submitted sequences that have no variation. ss FASTA contains all submitted SNP sequences in FASTA format, whereas rs FASTA contains all the reference SNP sequences in FASTA format.  The FASTA data format is typically used for sequence comparisons using BLAST. BLAST SNP is useful for conducting a few sequence comparisons in the FASTA format, wherease multiple FASTA sequence comparisons will require the construction of a local BLAST database of FASTA formatted data and the installation of a local stand-alone version of BLAST. 
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.2005">
							<title>rs docsum Flatfile</title>
							<p>
								The rs docsum flatfile report is generated from the ASN.1 datafiles and is provided in the  files /ASN1_flat/ds_flat_chXX.flat. As with all of the large report dumps, files are generated per chromosome (chXX in file name). Because flatfile reports are compact, they will not provide you with as much information as the ASN.1 binary report, but they are useful for scanning human SNP data manually because they provide detailed information at a glance. A full description of the information provided in the rs docsum flatfile format is available in the 00readme file, located in the SNP directory of the   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SNP FTP</ext-link>site.

							<title>Chromosome Reports</title>
							<p>
								The chromosome reports format provides an ordered list of RefSNPs in approximate chromosome coordinates.  Chromosome reports is a small file to download but contains a great deal of information that might be helpful in identifying SNPs useful as markers on maps or contigs because the coordinate system used in this format is the same as that used for the NCBI genome Map Viewer.  It should also be mentioned that the chromosome reports directory might contain the multi/ file and/or the noton/ files.  These files are lists (in chromosome report format) of SNPs that hit multiple chromosomes in the genome and those that did not hit any chromosomes in the genome, respectively.

						<title>Appendix 2. Rules and methodology for mapping.</title>
						<p>
							A cycle of flank sequence masking and MegaBLAST alignment to the NCBI genome assembly of an organism is initiated either by the appearance of FASTA-formatted genome sequence for a new build of the assembly or by the significant accrual of newly submitted SNP data for that organism. 
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.2008">
							<title>Flank Sequence Masking</title>
							<p>
								We prepare FASTA-formatted sequence for unclustered ss assays of a particular organism and run RepeatMasker (with the mixed case option set) on the sequence, using the appropriate ALU-repeat library. For human, we use   
								<preformat>
									repmask -q -xsmall
								</preformat>
								and for mouse we use   
								<preformat>
									repmask -m -q -xsmall
								</preformat> dust is used if no library of repetitive elements is available for the organism. The mixed case sequence is then loaded into the database, replacing the original submitted flank.  The SubSNPRepMask table is updated with repeat masker output that describes the nature and location of the repeat, and a set of mixed-case FASTA is prepared for the entire refSNP set.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.2009">
							<title>Organism-specific Genome Mapping</title>
							<p>
								Both refSNP and subSNP FASTA sets are aligned to the genome assembly using MegaBLAST, and the SNP position is computed from the list of ungapped alignments returned with the    -D1 option. We filter the alignments into either a high-threshold category (95 % of SNP flank aligning with fewer than sixth mismatches) or a low-threshold category (75% of the alignment length with fewer than 3% mismatches).  The rest of the MegaBLAST alignments are dropped.  MegaBLAST parameters are set to a default position with the exception of    -F m, which suppresses seeding hits but allows extension through regions of lowercase sequence.
							</p>
							<p>
								We also perform tailored BLAST algorithms to specialized subsets of the database that are known to fail or perform poorly in the standard pathway. Short sequences of 75 bases or fewer are BLASTed with word  size = 22.  To capture hits in cases where the variation length might break the alignment, each flank of microsatellites or indels are BLASTed independently and paired up in post processing to provide the SNP position. We perform high-stringency BLASTs for many of the heavily masked SNPs using wordsize = 40 and 99% quality in any alignment.  This is an attempt to capture low-multiplicity hits of repetitive sequence without overburdening the BLAST algorithm with a large number of seeded alignments.
							</p>
							<p>
								To reduce hit multiplicity in cases where SNPs align several times on the genome, we examine the relative hit quality of multiple hits. Hits are discarded when the mismatch count is greater than the minimum mismatch count. The mismatch count parameter is currently set to 3.  We BLAST refSNPs and subSNPs against GenBank mRNA, RefSeq mRNA, and GenBank clone accessions by a similar procedure.
							</p>
							<p>
								We send the output from the genome alignment (or clone alignment where a genome is not available) through a clustering procedure that assigns rs IDs to unclustered new submissions.  In some cases, this clustering procedure will re-cluster existing refSNP clusters based on colocation on the genome. After clustering, we update BLAST output to synchronize the ss IDs and the re-clustered rs IDs to the associated refSNP cluster defined in the database. Location data are loaded into the database, wherease cumulative hit data for each mapped SNP are computed and loaded to the database. Finally, we update SNPFlankStatus.

							When a protein is known to have a structure neighbor, dbSNP projects the RefSNPs located in that protein sequence onto sequence structures.

							First, contig annotation results provide the SNP ID (snp_id), protein accession (protein_acc), contig and SNP amino acid residue (residue), as well as the amino acid position (aa_position) for a particular RefSNP.  These data can be found in the dbSNP table, SNPContigLocusId.  FASTA sequence is then obtained for each protein accession using the program idfetch, with the command line parameters set to:

						<title>Site Description</title>
						<p>
							High-throughput hybridization array- and sequencing-based experiments have become increasingly common in molecular biology laboratories in recent years (
							14). These techniques are used to measure the molecular abundance of mRNA, genomic DNA, and proteins in absolute or relative terms.  The main attraction of these techniques is their highly parallel nature; large numbers of simultaneous molecular sampling events are performed under very similar conditions. This means that time and resources are saved, and complex biological systems can be represented in a more holistic manner. Furthermore, the development of tissue arrays means that it is possible to analyze, in parallel, the gene expression of large numbers of tumor tissue samples from patients at different stages of cancer development (
							5).

							Because of the plethora of measuring techniques for molecular abundance in use, our primary goal in creating the Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GEO</ext-link>) was to cover the broadest possible spectrum of these techniques and remain flexible and responsive to future trends, rather than choosing only one of these techniques or setting rigid requirements and standards for entry. In taking this approach, however, we recognize that there are obvious, inherent limitations to functionality and analysis that can be provided on such heterogeneous data sets.
						</p>
						<p>
							This chapter is both more current and more detailed than the previous literature report on GEO (
							6). However, more detailed descriptions, tools, and news releases are available on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GEO Web site</ext-link>.

							The three principle components (or entities) of GEO are modeled after the three organizational unit common to high-throughput gene expression and array-based methodologies. These entities are called <italic>platforms</italic>, <italic>samples</italic>and <italic>series</italic>(Figure 1; Table 1).  A <italic>platform</italic>is, essentially, a list of probes that defines what set of molecules may be detected in any experiment using that platform. A <italic>sample</italic>describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate molecular abundance data. Each sample has one, and only one, parent platform that must be defined previously. A <italic>series</italic>organizes samples into the meaningful data sets that make up an experiment and are bound together by a common attribute.
						</p>
						<p>
							The GEO repository is a relational database, which required that some fundamental implementation decisions were made:
						</p>
						<p>
							(<italic>a</italic>) GEO does not store raw hybridization-array image data, although reference images of less than 100 Kb may be stored. This decision was based on an assertion that most users of the data within the GEO repository would not be equipped to use raw image data (
							7); although some may disagree, this means that repository storage requirements are reduced roughly by a factor of 20.
						</p>
						<p>
							(<italic>b</italic>) We decided to use a different storage mechanism for data and metadata. Within the GEO repository, metadata are stored in designated fields within the database table. However, data from the entire set of probe attributes (for each platform) and molecular abundance measurements (for each sample) are stored as a single, text-compressed BLOB. This mode of data storage allows great flexibility in the amount and type of information stored in this BLOB. It allows any number of supplementary attributes or measurements to be provided by the submitter, including optional or submitter-defined information. For example, a microarray (the platform) consisting of several thousand spots (the probes) would have a set of probe attributes, some of which are defined by GEO. The GEO-defined attributes include, for each probe, the position within the array and biological reagent contents of each probe such as a GenBankAccession number, open reading frame (ORF) name, and clone identifier, as well as any number of submitter-defined columns. As another example, the set of probe-target measurements given in the data from a sample may contain the final, relevant abundance value of the probe defined in its platform, as well as any other GEO-defined (e.g., raw signal, background signal) and submitter-defined data.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once a platform, sample, or series is defined by a submitter, an Accession number (i.e., a unique, stable identifier) is assigned (Figure 2). Whether a GEO Accession number refers to a platform, sample, or series can be understood by the Accession number prefix. Platforms have the prefix GPL, samples have the prefix GSM, and series have the prefix GSE.

							<title>SOFT.</title>
							<p>
								Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) is a line-based, ASCII text format that allows for the representation of multiple GEO platforms, samples, and series in one file. In SOFT, metadata appear as label-value pairs and are associated with the tab-delimited text tables of platforms and samples. SOFT has been designed for easy manipulation by readily available line-scanning software and may be quite readily produced from, and imported into, spreadsheet, database, and analysis software. More information about SOFT and the submission process is available from the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GEO Web site</ext-link>.
							</p>
						</boxed-text>
						<p>
							There are several formats in which data can be deposited and retrieved from GEO. For deposit: (1) a file containing an ASCII-encoded text table of data can be uploaded, and metadata fields can be interactively entered through a series of Web forms; or (2) both data and metadata for one or more platforms, samples, or series can be uploaded directly in a format we call Simple Omnibus Format in Text, or SOFT (Box 2).
						</p>
						<p>
							Interactive and direct modes of communication are available for new data submissions and updating data submissions. The interactive Web form route is straightforward and most suited for occasional submissions of a relatively small number of samples. Bulk submissions of large data sets may be rapidly incorporated into GEO via direct deposit of SOFT formatted data.
						</p>
						<p>
							Submissions may be held private for a maximum of 6 months; this policy allows data release concordant with manuscript publication. Such submissions are given a final Accession number at the time of submission, which may be quoted in a publication.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, submissions are validated according to a limited set of criteria (see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GEO Web site</ext-link>for more details). Submissions are scanned by our staff to assure that the submissions are organized correctly and include meaningful information. It is entirely up to the submitter to make the data useful to others.
						</p>
						<p>
							A quarterly, cumulative graph of the number of individual molecular abundance measurements in public submissions made through the first quarter of 2002 is shown in Figure 4.

							<title>Entrez ProbeSet indexing and linking process.</title>
							<p>
								The basic unit (defined by a unique identifier, or UID, in Entrez parlance) in Entrez ProbeSet is the GEO sample, fused with its affiliated platform and series information. The indexing process iterates through all platforms in the GEO database, extracting metadata and the data table and fishing for any sequence-based identifiers such as GenBank Accession, ORFs, Clone IDs, or SAGE tags. Each sample belonging to that platform is in turn assigned a new UID and indexed with the above platform information plus any related series metadata (  Table 2).
							</p>
							<p>
								GenBank Accessions, PubMed references, and taxonomy information are also linked to the appropriate Entrez databases for cross-reference and appear in the    Links section of the display. Neighbors (related intra-Entrez database links) are generated for UIDs sharing the same GEO platform or series.
							</p>
						</boxed-text>
						<p>
							Extensive indexing and linking on the data in GEO are performed periodically and can be queried through Entrez ProbeSet (Box 3). Many users of Entrez will recognize this interface as similar to that of other popular NCBI resources such as PubMedand GenBank. As with any Entrez database, a Booleanphrase may be entered and restricted to any number of supported attribute fields (Table 2). Matches are linked to the full GEO entry as well as to other Entrez databases, currently Nucleotide, Taxonomy, and PubMed, as well as related Entrez ProbeSet entries. (See Chapter 15for more details.) Entrez ProbeSet is accessible through the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=geo" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Entrez Web site</ext-link>as one of the drop-down menu selections.

						<title>Example of Retrieving Data</title>
						<p>
							Because samples are oftentimes organized into meaningful data sets within series, an example of retrieving a series and all the data of its associated samples and platform(s) is illustrative of the retrieval capabilities of the GEO Web site. For this example, to select a series of interest, we scan down a list of series in the GEO repository. However, to arrive at our series of interest, we could have just as well performed an Entrez ProbeSet query and followed GEO accession links to a sample and then to its related series, or followed links from PubMed to Entrez ProbeSet, and then to GEO. A step-by-step example of selecting a series of data and retrieving the data for this series from the GEO repository follows:

							The GEO resource is under constant development and aims to improve its indexing, linking, searching, and display capabilities to allow vigorous data mining. Because the data sets stored within GEO are from heterogeneous techniques and sources, they are not necessarily comparable. For this reason, we have defined a ProbeSet to be a collection of GEO samples that contains comparable data. The selection of GEO samples into ProbeSets is necessary before integrating data in the GEO repository into other NCBI resources (see Chapter 15, Chapter 16, and Chapter 20), as well as for developing useful display tools for these data (Figure 5).

Books have been added to the BookShelf in collaboration with authors and publishers, and the complete content (including all figures and tables) is free to use for anyone with an Internet connection.
						</p>
						<p>
							The online books are displayed one section at a time, with navigation provided to other parts of the current chapter or to other chapters within the book. Many of the books on the BookShelf can be browsed without any restriction at all; others have less flexibility for navigating the complete content. The publisher (or the owner of the content) defines the rules for access.
						</p>
						<p>
							The books are linked to PubMed through research papers citations within the text. In the future, more links may be established between the BookShelf and other resources at NCBI, such as gene and protein sequences, genomes, and macromolecular structures.

						<sec id="bid.425">
							<title>Basis for Inclusion</title>
							<p>
								The BookShelf provides a venue through which publishers and authors can make the full text of biomedical books available to the scientific community. As the BookShelf grows, we welcome proposals from authors, editors, or publishers of any in-scope texts, from undergraduate textbooks to more specialized publications, including collections of review articles or workshop proceedings. The scope of the BookShelf is broadly biomedical, including clinical works and those concerning basic biological and chemical sciences.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.426">
							<title>Information for Authors, Editors, and Publishers</title>
							<p>
								All books made available on the BookShelf have been provided in electronic format to   NCBI. The publisher must provide the content   <italic>in full</italic>. Because the complete content is required for display and indexing purposes, the authors, editors, and publisher of a book should all be a part of the decision to participate in the BookShelf. Interested parties can contact us at 
								<email>books@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>for more information or to make a proposal for the inclusion of a book. There is a simple contract that specifies the terms of use of the content. A sample contract can also be obtained by request at the above email address.
							</p>
							<p>
								The complete contents of each book will be converted into   XMLaccording to the NCBI Book Document Type Definition (  DTD), a public domain DTD developed at NCBI for this project (see below). Books may be submitted to conform to this DTD, or NCBI will convert the source data to validate against the Book DTD. If a conversion needs to be done, the content must be in a format robust enough to meet the needs of the BookShelf publishing system and DTD.
							</p>
							<p>
								Any book that was printed from   SGMLor XML should allow for a straightforward conversion. We have had success converting books from Word, XYWrite, PDF, and Quark Express formats, and we anticipate that we would also be able to convert from other desktop publishing packages.   HTMLand PDF formats are less desirable because the data formats are less detailed.
							</p>
							<p>
								Figures should be supplied in TIFF format, although GIF and JPEG formats may be accepted. The submitted text files are converted into XML according to the NCBI Book DTD; graphic files are converted into GIF and JPEG formats. Three hard copies of the book are also required, along with the electronic files.
							</p>
							<p>
								The XML files are stored in a database. When a reader requests a book, chapter, or section, the XML is retrieved from the database and converted into HTML on the fly using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">XSLT</ext-link>) and Cascading Style Sheets (  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CSS</ext-link>).

						<title>How to Use the Books</title>
						<p>
							There are three ways to access the content in BookShelf:
						</p>
						<p>
							1. Through hyperlinked terms in PubMed abstracts
						</p>
						<p>
							2. By a direct search using search terms or phrases (in the same way as the bibliographic database of PubMed is searched)
						</p>
						<p>
							3. Through the Table of Contents of the book (note: some publishers restrict browsing through the entire book by disabling hyperlinks in the Table of Contents)
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.428">
							<title>Links from PubMed</title>
							<p>
								The BookShelf can be accessed from all PubMed abstract pages. When viewing a full PubMed abstract, select the    Books hyperlink in the upper right-hand corner. This generates a version of the abstract in which certain phrases and terms appear as hypertext links (see   Figure 1). The linked term may be one or more words in length. If a word or a phrase is linked, it means that the exact phrase also appears in at least one book. Selecting a linked phrase retrieves a list of books that contain that term.  
								<fig id="bid.429">
									<label>
										1
									</label>
									<caption>
										<title>A PubMed abstract showing terms linked to books.</title>
										<p>
											This view was generated by selecting    Links found in the   <italic>top right corner</italic>of the abstract and then selecting    Books from the drop-down menu that appears.
										</p>
									</caption>
									<graphic mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="ch8f1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
								</fig>
							</p>
							<p>
								A statistical weighting system based on the frequency of each phrase in a book section, relative to the rest of the book, is used to identify good phrases. A phrase that appears repeatedly in only a few sections and rarely in other parts of the book indicates a definitive phrase for those few sections; therefore, it ranks highly. Furthermore, the appearance of a phrase in the title, for example, has a greater value in the weighting system than one appearing solely in the text.
							</p>
							<p>
								Each PubMed abstract can thus be linked to the appropriate book pages. This method allows two very dissimilar types of textthe dense, focused PubMed abstracts and the more descriptive book textto find common ground.

								Results are shown as a list of books in which the term is found, along with the number of sections, figures, and tables that contain the term (  Figure 2). The book that contains the most hits appears at the top of the list. Choosing the hyperlinked number of items that is associated with a particular book will then display a document summary list of the individual sections, figures, and tables found. (When a term or phrase is found fewer than 20 times within the BookShelf, the document summary page is shown directly, without first displaying the results clustered by book.)

								The document summary list is sorted with the most relevant documents shown at the top of the page. The sorting makes use of scores allocated to phrases as a measure of how relevant they are to a given section (a part of the statistical weighting system also used for linking PubMed abstracts to the books). For each book section found, the title, along with some context regarding the hierarchy of the section location (e.g., the chapter and book), is given. An icon is used to distinguish figure legends and tables from text sections (  Figure 3). Selecting a hyperlinked section title displays the part of the book that contains the search term. From this point, the user may be able to navigate further throughout the book content, according to the policy of the publisher (see   <italic>Navigating Book Content</italic>).

							<title>Navigating Book Content</title>
							<p>
								Each HTML page of content seen in a Web browser represents one section of one chapter of a book, i.e., all of the content (including subsections and so on) within the first-level heading of a chapter. The amount of content this represents varies according to the structure of the original book. Some books have very long sections, some short, some a mixture; although on the whole, most chapters are divided into 3-10 sections.
							</p>
							<p>
								The top of every page contains links to both short and detailed Tables of Contents and a description of the current location within the book (  Figure 4). The hierarchal elements that describe the current location are hyperlinked and may be used to travel up the organizational levels of a book. Additionally, a navigation sidebar shows the current section among its peers and lists the figures and tables found within the current section (  Figure 4). Reference citations in the text are linked where possible to PubMed abstracts by the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/citmatch.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Citation Matcher</ext-link>. References internal to the book, e.g., to other chapters or sections, figures, tables, and boxes, are also hyperlinked. Further navigation from the current page to other parts of the book depends on the access policy of the publisher.

Hyperlinks may be disabled within some books at the request of the publisher. A    Search box is located   <italic>below</italic>the navigation bar. At the   <italic>top</italic>of each page is a hyperlinked, hierarchical tree that illustrates a page's relative position within a book.

							<title>Text Conversion and XML</title>
							<p>
								All book content submitted to the BookShelf is converted to XML according to the public NCBI Book DTD.
							</p>
							<p>
								Any files submitted in SGML or XML are converted to the Book DTD using   XSLT. Books submitted in desktop publishing or word processing formats are converted by a contractor using proprietary technologies. Once the book XML is valid against the DTD, the book is ready to be loaded into the database.
							</p>
							<p>
								The XML for a book is generally a set of files. Each chapter and appendix is an independent file, as is the frontmatter. The book is pulled together by the book.xml file, which defines the structure of the book. For example, a book with two chapters and a bibliography at the end of the book would be structured as follows: 
								<preformat>
									&lt;!DOCTYPE book SYSTEM &quot;ncbi-book.dtd&quot; [ &lt;!-- graphics --&gt;&lt;!ENTITY % Graphics SYSTEM &quot;graphics.xml&quot;&gt;%Graphics; &lt;!ENTITY frontmatter SYSTEM &quot;fm.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;!ENTITY chapter1 SYSTEM &quot;ch1.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;!ENTITY chapter2 SYSTEM &quot;ch2.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;!--back--&gt;; &lt;!ENTITY biblist SYSTEM &quot;biblist.xml&quot;&gt;]&gt;&lt;book&gt;&amp;frontmatter; &lt;body&gt;&amp;chapter1; &amp;chapter2; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;back&gt;&amp;biblist; &lt;/back&gt;&lt;/book&gt;
								</preformat>
							</p>
							<p>
								The book.xml file is composed of two parts. The first part defines all of the components that are required to build the book. These definitions occur within the &lt;!DOCTYPE [ ] &gt; tag. The second part builds the structure of the book. The root element is &lt;book&gt;. &lt;book&gt; contains whatever is in &amp;frontmatter;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;back&gt;.
							</p>
							<p>
								The book.xml example above refers to five external files: fm.xml, which contains all of the frontmatter of the book; ch1.xml, which contains chapter 1; ch2.xml, which contains chapter 2; biblist.xml, which contains the bibliography for the book; and graphics.xml, which defines the images. If any of these files is not valid according to the DTD or if the files are not found where they are defined in their &lt;!ENTITY &gt; declaration, then the book will not be valid.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.439">
							<title>Images</title>
							<p>
								All of the images, including figures, icons, and book-specific character graphics (see Special Characters below), are called out in the text as entities. The entities are defined in the graphics.xml file.
							</p>
							<p>
								&lt;!ENTITY ch2fu6 SYSTEM &quot;data/mga/pictures/ch2/ch2fu6.gif&quot; NDATA GIF&gt;
							</p>
							<p>
								&lt;!ENTITY ch2fu7 SYSTEM &quot;data/mga/pictures/ch2/ch2fu7.jpg&quot; NDATA JPG&gt;

							<p>
								&lt;!ENTITY ch2e2 SYSTEM &quot;data/mga/pictures/ch2/ch2e2.gif&quot; NDATA GIF&gt;

							<title>Special Characters</title>
							<p>
								The BookShelf uses the same character sets that PubMed Central uses (see   Chapter 9). These include a number of standard   ISOcharacter sets (8879 and 9573), along with a set of characters that has been defined to accommodate characters not in the standard set. The ISO Standard Character sets referenced are listed in Box 1 of   Chapter 9. Special characters are converted to the BookShelf/PubMed Central (  PMC) character set during conversion into XML. Characters created for one book (book-specific characters) are called out in the XML as images. To provide for the most flexibility in displaying characters across platforms, BookShelf uses   UTF-8encoding whenever possible. Because not all browsers support the same subset of UTF-8 characters and some characters cannot be represented in UTF-8, the BookShelf displays characters as a combination of GIFs and UTF-8 characters, depending on the Browser/OS combination and the character to be displayed.

						<title>The BookShelf Data Flow</title>
						<p>
							The XML files for each book are stored in a Sybasedatabase. To show the best representation to each reader, the reader's browser and operating system are noted and passed to the rendering software. When a reader requests a book, chapter, or section, the XML and the character images or UTF-8 characters appropriate to the reader's system are retrieved from the database.
						</p>
						<p>
							The XML is converted to HTML using XSLT stylesheets. The look of the HTML pages is controlled further using CSS, which allow manipulation of colors, fonts, and typefaces (Figure 5).

						<p>
							The Table of Contents for a book is created from actual elements within the book content, rather than from the Table of Contents given in the book frontmatter of the hard copy. This ensures that the Table of Contents represents the content accurately as it is organized on BookShelf.

							<title>History</title>
							<p>
								In the first version of the NCBI BookShelf project, Quark files were converted directly to HTML for display online. The result was effective, illustrating the value of having a textbook online and linked to PubMed; however, it was labor intensive, limiting, and not scaleable.
							</p>
							<p>
								To simplify the delivery of books online and to allow for the expansion of linking within the Entrez system, NCBI decided to convert all content into a centralized XML format. The normalized XML content is easier to render, allows added value such as the addition of links to other NCBI databases, and simplifies the addition of new volumes.
							</p>
							<p>
								PMC created a new DTD for the BookShelf project, which was based on the ISO-12803 DTD. As more books were converted to the NCBI Book DTD, changes had to be made to accommodate the data.
							</p>
							<p>
								The NCBI Book DTD is a public DTD available on request from

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							PubMed Central (PMC) is the National Library of Medicine's digital archive of full-text journal literature. Journals deposit material in PMC on a voluntary basis. Articles in PMC may be retrieved either by browsing a table of contents for a specific journal or by searching the database. Certain journals allow the full text of their articles to be viewed directly in PMC. These are always free, although there may be a time lag of a few weeks to a year or more between publication of a journal issue and when it is available in PMC. Other journals require that PMC direct users to the journal's own Web site to see the full text of an article. In this case, the material will always be available free to any user no more than 1 year after publication but will usually be available only to the journal's subscribers for the first 6 months to 1 year.
						</p>
						<p>
							To increase the functionality of the database, a variety of links are added to the articles in PMC: between an article correction and the original article; from an article to other articles in PMC that cite it; from a citation in the references section to the corresponding abstract in PubMed and to its full text in PMC; and from an article to related records in other Entrez databases such as Reference Sequences, OMIM, and Books.

							Every article citation in a table of contents includes one or more links (Figure 2). Articles for which the full text is available directly in PMC generally have links to an Abstract view, a Full Text view, and a PDF (printable view). Where applicable, they also have links to Corrections and to supplementary data that may be available for the article. In cases where the full text is available only at the journal publisher's site, there is only one link, to a PubLink page (described below).

							In addition to the header information for the article itself, the upper part of a Full Text or PubLink page contains a variety of links, including links to other forms of the article, to related information in PubMed and other Entrezdatabases, and to corrections or cited-in lists where these apply (Figure 3). The sidebar in the body of a Full Text page (Figure 4) has links to tables and thumbnail images of any figures in the article, which when selected will display the full figure. Figures and tables may also be opened directly from the point in the text where they are referenced. Citations in the References section of an article frequently include a link to the corresponding PubMed abstract and sometimes also have a link to the full text of the referenced article in PMC (Figure 5).

						<title>Participation in PMC</title>
						<p>
							Participation by publishers in PMC is voluntary, although participating journals must meet certain editorial standards. A participating journal is expected to include all of its peer-reviewed primary research articles in PMC. Journals are encouraged to also deposit other content such as review articles, essays, and editorials. Review journals, and similar publications that have no primary research articles, are also invited to include their contents in PMC. However, primary research papers without peer review are not accepted.
						</p>
						<p>
							Journals that deposit material in PMC may make the full text viewable directly in PMC or may require that PMC link to the journal site for viewing the complete article. In the latter case, the full text must be freely available at the journal site no more than 1 year after publication. In the case of full text that is viewable directly in PMC, which by definition is free, the journal may delay the release of its material for more than 1 year after publication, although all current journals have delays of 1 year or less.
						</p>
						<p>
							In either case, the journal must provide SGMLor XMLfor the full text, along with any related high-resolution image files. All data must meet PMC standards for syntactically correct and complete data.
						</p>
						<p>
							The rationale behind the insistence on free access is that continued use of the material, which is encouraged by open access, serves as the best test of the durability and utility of the archive as technology changes over time. PMC does not claim copyright on any material deposited in the archive. Copyright remains with the journal publisher or with individual authors, whichever is applicable.

							PubMed Central is an XML-based publishing system for full-text journal articles. All journal content in the archive was either supplied in, or has been converted to, a Document Type Definition (DTD) written at NCBIfor the publication and storage of full-text articles.
						</p>
						<p>
							The content is displayed dynamically on the PMC site by journal, volume, and issue (if applicable). XML, Web graphics, PDFs, and supplemental data are stored in a Sybasedatabase. When a reader requests an article, the XML is retrieved from the database, and it is converted to HTMLusing XSLTstylesheets. The look of the HTML pages is controlled further by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which allow manipulation of colors, fonts, and typefaces.

						<title>Data Flow: 1. SGML/XML Processing</title>
						<p>
							We receive journal content either directly from publishers or from publishers' vendors. This content includes:
							<list list-type="bullet">
								<list-item id="bid.470">
									<p>
										SGML or XML of the articles to be deposited
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.471">
									<p>
										High-resolution images
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.472">
									<p>
										Supplemental data associated with the articles
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.473">
									<p>
										PDF versions of the articles
									</p>
								</list-item>
							</list>
						</p>
						<p>
							All of the text is converted to a central DTD, the PMC DTD, and the images are converted to Web format (GIF and JPEG). These files, along with any supplemental data or PDFs, are loaded into the database for linking, indexing, and retrieval (Figure 8). The source text in SGML or XML format is parsed against the source DTD. If the source files do not conform to the DTD, they are returned to the publisher or vendor for correction.

						</p>
						<p>
							Once all of the files in an issue or batch have been validated, they are converted to PMC XML (referred to as a PMC XML file or PXML) using XSLT (Figure 9). Because XSLT is an XML conversion tool, SGML source files must first be converted to XML. This is done using SX, which is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/index.htm" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">James Clark</ext-link>. The transformation will close any empty elements and insert ending tags for any element that is not closed.

							</fig>
						</p>
						<p>
							For each publisher that submits SGML, an XML version of the DTD is created. This is used to parse the output of SX before the XML conversion is started. The XML version of the publisher's DTD is not used to validate the source data (because this has already been done using the original DTD).
						</p>
						<p>
							XSLT requires that the input file be valid XML. If a DTD is not available for validation, the parser will check the syntax; it will also replace all of the character entities with the appropriate UTF-8representation. This can cause a problem because the relationship between the characters in the input file and their UTF-8 representations may not be one to one. This means that characters translated to UTF-8 might not translate back to the original character entity accurately.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the XSLT conversion, the original character entities are converted to character entities that are valid under the PMC DTD. Character translation tables for each source DTD regulate this conversion.
						</p>
						<p>
							The resulting XML is then validated against the PMC DTD.
						</p>
						<p>
							Several other items are created along with the PXML file. These are:
						</p>
						<p>
							1. An entity file (articlename.ent). This file lists all of the character entities (from the PMC DTD-defined entity sets) that are in the article. One entity file is created for each article. This information is loaded into the database and is used to prepare the final HTML file for display. A sample is below:
							<preformat>
								agr   deg   Dgr    lsqb   lt   pmc811   mdash
							</preformat>
						</p>
						<p>
							2. A PubMedID file (articlename.pmid). This file includes a set of reference citations in the format  
							<preformat>
								Journal_Title|year|volume|first_page|AuthorName|Refno|pubmedid
							</preformat>
						</p>
						<p>
							When the article is converted, this information is collected from each journal citation in the bibliography and sent in a query to PubMed (using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/getids.cgi" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Citation Matcher</ext-link>utility). If a value is returned, it is written in the last field. If no value is returned, an error message is written in this field. This information is saved so that if the article ever needs to be reconverted, the PubMed IDs will not need to be looked up again. A sample is below:  
							<preformat>

							</preformat>
						</p>
						<p>
							3. A source node file (articlename.src). When an article is passed through the XSLT conversion, a list is made of each node, or named piece of information, that is included in the file. As the conversion is running, each node that is being processed is recorded. When the conversion is complete, the processed node list is compared with the list of nodes in the source file, and any piece of information that was not processed is reported in a conversion log. A sample is below:  
							<preformat>

						</p>
						<sec id="bid.476">
							<title>Image Processing</title>
							<p>
								To accommodate the archiving requirements of the PubMed Central project, it is important that figures be submitted in the greatest resolution possible, in TIFF or EPS format. Figures in these formats will be available for data migration when formats change in the future, and PubMed Central will be able to keep all of the figures current.
							</p>
							<p>
								For display on the PMC site, two copies of each figure are made: a GIF thumbnail (100 pixels wide) and a JPEG file that will be displayed with the figure caption when the figure is requested.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.477">
							<title>Supplemental Data Processing</title>
							<p>
								Supplemental data include any supporting information that accompanies the article but is not part of the article. They may be text files, Word document files, spreadsheet files, executables, video, and others.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sometimes a journal has a Web site where all of this supplemental information is stored. In this case, PubMed Central establishes links from the article to the supplemental information on the publisher's site.
							</p>
							<p>
								In other cases, the supplemental data files are submitted with the article to be loaded into the PMC database. Either way, the information concerning this supplemental data is collected in a Supplemental Data file, which includes the location of the supplemental file(s), the type of information that is available, and how the link should be built from the article. PMC does not validate any of the supplemental data files that are supplied.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.478">
							<title>Mathematics</title>
							<p>
								Mathematical symbols and notations can be difficult to display in HTML because of built-up expressions and unusual characters. For the most part, expressions that are simple enough to display using HTML are not handled as math unless they are tagged as math specifically. Publishers that supply content to PMC handle math expressions in one of two ways: supplied images or encoding in SGML.
							</p>
							<sec id="bid.479">
								<title>1. Math Images</title>
								<p>
									Any expression that cannot be tagged by the source DTD is supplied as an image. In this case, PMC will pass the image callout through to the PXML file and display the supplied image in the HTML file.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.480">
								<title>2. Math in SGML</title>
								<p>
									Several of the Source DTDs used by publishers to submit data to PMC are robust enough to allow coding of almost any mathematical expression in SGML. Most of these were derived from the Elsevier DTD; therefore, many of the elements are similar.
								</p>
								<p>
									During article conversion, any items that are recognized as math are translated into Te. This would include any expression tagged specifically as a formula or display formula, as well as any free-standing expression that cannot be represented in HTML. These expressions include radicals, fractions, and anything with an overbar (other than accented characters). For example: 
									<disp-quote>
										<p>
											<italic>x</italic>+   <italic>y</italic>= 2  <italic>z</italic>would not be recognized as a math expression, but &lt;formula&gt;  <italic>x</italic>+   <italic>y</italic>= 2  <italic>z</italic>&lt;/formula&gt; would be.
										</p>
									</disp-quote>
									<disp-quote>
										<p>
											1/2 would not be recognized as a math expression, but &lt;fraction&gt;&lt;numerator&gt;1&lt;/numerator&gt;&lt;denominator&gt;2 &lt;/denominator&gt;&lt;/fraction&gt; would be.
										</p>
									</disp-quote>
									<disp-quote>
										<p>
											&lt;radical&gt;2x&lt;/radical&gt; would be recognized as a math expression, as would &lt;overbar&gt;47X&lt;/overbar&gt;.
										</p>
									</disp-quote>
								</p>
								<p>
									The SGML:
									<preformat>
										&lt;FD ID=&quot;E2&quot;&gt;I&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;UP&gt;o&lt;/UP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;INF&gt;&lt;UP&gt;f&lt;/UP&gt;&lt;/INF&gt;&amp;cjs1134;I&lt;INF&gt;&lt;UP&gt;f&lt;/UP&gt;&lt;/INF&gt;=&amp;phgr; &lt;SUP&gt;&lt;UP&gt;o&lt;/UP&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;INF&gt;&lt;UP&gt;f&lt;/UP&gt;&lt;/INF&gt;&amp;cjs1134;&amp;phgr;&lt;INF&gt; &lt;UP&gt;f&lt;/UP&gt;&lt;/INF&gt;=1&amp;plus;K&lt;INF&gt;&lt;UP&gt;sv&lt;/UP&gt;&lt;/INF&gt;&amp;lsqb;&lt;UP&gt;Q &lt;/UP&gt;&amp;rsqb;&lt;/FD&gt;
									</preformat>
								</p>
								<p>
									Converts to:
									<preformat>

						<title>Data Flow: 2. Loading the Database</title>
						<p>
							Because all of the content in PubMed Central is in the same formatPMC DTDloading articles into the database is relatively straightforward. Once an article is loaded into the production (public) database, it will retain its ArticleId (article ID number) in perpetuity. On loading, each article is validated against the PMC DTD. Also, any external files that are referenced by the XML are checked. If any file, such as a figure, is missing, the loading will be aborted.
						</p>
						<p>
							The database loading software and daily maintenance programs perform several other tests to ensure the accuracy and vitality of the archive:
							<list list-type="arabic">
								<list-item id="bid.483">
									<label>
										1
									</label>
									<p>
										Journal identity. The Journal title being loaded is verified against the ISSNnumber in the PXML to verify that the journal identity is correct.
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.484">
									<label>
										2
									</label>
									<p>
										Duplicate articles. An article may not be loaded more than once. Any changes to the article must be submitted as a replacement article, which will use the same ArticleId.
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.485">
									<label>
										3
									</label>
									<p>
										Publication date/delay. Rules for delay of publication embargo can be set up in the database to ensure that an issue will not be released to the public before a certain amount of time has passed since the publisher made the issue available.
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.486">
									<label>
										4
									</label>
									<p>
										PubMed IDs. PubMedIDs for the article being loaded or any bibliographic citation in the article that are not defined in the PXML are looked up upon loading.
									</p>
								</list-item>
								<list-item id="bid.487">
									<label>
										5
									</label>
									<p>
										Link updates. Links between related articles and from articles to external sources are updated daily.
									</p>
								</list-item>
							</list>
						</p>
						<p>
							The database has been designed to allow multiple versions of articles. In addition to article information, the database also stores information on content suppliers and publishers and journal-specific information.

							PubMed Central uses a number of standard ISOcharacter sets (8879 and 9573), along with a set of characters that has been defined to accommodate characters not in the standard set. The ISO Standard Character sets referenced are listed in Box 1
							.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each publisher DTD defines a set of characters that may be used in their articles. Generally, these publisher DTDs use the same standard ISO character sets listed in Box 1. Any character that cannot be represented by the standard ISO sets is defined in a publisher-specific character set. These publisher-specified characters are converted into characters in the PMC entity list during conversion (see <italic>SGML/XML Processing</italic>). The PMC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/dtd/pmc.ent" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">entity list</ext-link>is publicly available.
						</p>
						<p>
							The supplied data also include groups of entities that are to be combined in the final document. Sometimes these are grouped in a tag such as: 
							<preformat>
								&lt;A&gt;&lt;AC&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/AC&gt;&lt;AC&gt;&amp;acute;&lt;/AC&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
							</preformat>
						</p>
						<p>
							and sometimes they are just positioned next to each other in the text. These combined entities must be mapped either to an ISO character or to a character in the PMC character set.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the most flexibility in displaying characters across platforms, PMC uses UTF-8 encoding whenever possible. Because not all browsers support the same subset of UTF-8 characters and some characters cannot be represented in UTF-8, PMC displays characters as a combination of GIFs and UTF-8 characters, depending on the Browser/OS combination and the character to be displayed.

						<sec id="bid.491">
							<title>History</title>
							<p>
								In the first version of the PMC project, the SGML and XML were loaded into a database in its native format. The HTML rendering software was then required to convert content from different sources into normalized HTML on the fly when a reader requested an article.
							</p>
							<p>
								This was slow and cumbersome on the rendering side and was not scaleable. At that time, PMC was receiving content for about five journals in two DTDs, the keton.dtd from HighWire Press and the article.dtd from BioMed Central. The set-up for a new journal was difficult, and it soon became obvious that this solution would not scale easily.
							</p>
							<p>
								To satisfy the archiving requirement for the PMC project and to simplify the delivery of articles online, PubMed Central decided to convert all content into a centralized format. The normalized content is easier to render, allows enhanced value such as links to other NCBI databases to be added, and simplifies content archiving.
							</p>
							<p>
								PMC created a new DTD, which was strongly influenced by the BioMedCentral article.dtd and the keton.dtd. The original emphasis was on simplicity. As more and more articles from more and more journals were converted to the PMC DTD, changes had to be made to accommodate the data. The   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/dtd/pmc-1.dtd" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PMC DTD</ext-link>is publicly available.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.492">
							<title>Review and Revision of the PMC DTD</title>
							<p>
								Because the PMC DTD grew rapidly, it was feared that the original simplicity of its design would lead to confusing data structures. With more and more publishers inquiring about submitting content directly in the PMC DTD, PubMed Central decided that an independent review was necessary.   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mulberrytech.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Mulberry Technologies, Inc.</ext-link>, an electronic publishing consultancy specializing in SGML- and XML-based systems, reviewed the DTD and created a modified version.
							</p>
							<p>
								At approximately the same time, under the auspices of a Mellon Grant to explore ejournal archiving, Harvard University Library contracted with   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inera.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Inera, Inc.</ext-link>to review a variety of DTDs from selected publishers, PMC included. The study focused on two key questions: 
								<list list-type="arabic">
									<list-item id="bid.493">
										<label>
											1
										</label>
										<p>
											Can a common DTD be designed and developed into which publishers' proprietary SGML files can be transformed to meet the requirements of an archiving institution?
										</p>
									</list-item>
									<list-item id="bid.494">
										<label>
											2
										</label>
										<p>
											If such a structure can be developed, what are the issues that will be encountered when transforming publishers' SGML files into the archive structure for deposit into the archive?
										</p>
									</list-item>
								</list>
							</p>
							<p>
								The requirement of the archival article DTD was defined as the ability to represent the intellectual content of journal articles. This   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">study</ext-link>is available and suggestions from the study were used in the NLM Archiving DTD Suite. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The NLM Archiving DTD will not be backwards-compatible with the pmc-1.dtd. It should be publicly available by the end of 2002, along with complete documentation for publishers and authors. A draft version is available (  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/dtd/nlm_lib/0.1/documentation/HTML/index.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/dtd/nlm_lib/0.1/documentation/HTML/index.html</ext-link>), along with a draft version of the documentation.

							Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) (
							17) and Comparative Genomic Hybidization (CGH) (
							811) are complementary fluorescent molecular cytogenetic techniques that have revolutionized the detection of chromosomal abnormalities. SKY permits the simultaneous visualization of all human or mouse chromosomes in a different color, facilitating the detection of chromosomal translocations and rearrangements (Figure 1). CGH uses the hybridization of differentially labeled tumor and reference DNA to generate a map of DNA copy number changes in tumor genomes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The goal of the SKY/CGH database is to allow investigators to submit and analyze both clinical and research (e.g., cell lines) SKY and CGH data. The database is growing and currently has a total of about 700 datasets, some of which are being held private until published. Several hundred labs around the world use this technique, with many more looking at the data they generate. Submitters can enter data from their own cases in either of two formats, public or private; the public data is generally that which has already been published, whereas the private data can be viewed only by the submitters, who can transfer it to the public format at their discretion. The results are stored under the name of the submitter and are listed according to case number. The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sky/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">homepage</ext-link>includes a basic description of SKY and CGH techniques and provides links to a more detailed explanation and relevant literature.

								The submitter enters the written   karyotype, the number of normal and abnormal copies for each chromosome, and the number of cells for each clone. Each abnormal chromosome segment is then described by typing in the beginning and ending bands, starting from the top of the chromosome (  Figure 2); the computer then builds a colored   ideogramof this chromosome and eventually a full karyotype (  SKYGRAM) with each normal and abnormal chromosome displayed in its unique SKY classification color, with band overlay (  Figure 3). Each breakpoint submitted is automatically linked by a button marked   FISHto the human Map Viewer (  Figure 4;   Chapter 20), which provides a list of genes at that site and available FISH clones for that breakpoint.

								<title>Karyotype Parser</title>
								<p>
									To speed up the entry of cytogenetic data into the database, NCBI has built a computer program to automatically read short-form karyotypes, extract the information therein, and insert it into the SKY database ( Figure 7). Karyotypes are written according to specific rules described in <italic>An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (1995)</italic>( 12). Using these rules, the parser (1) breaks the karyotype into small syntactic components, (2) assembles information from these components into an information structure in computer memory, (3) transforms this information into the formats required for an application, and (4) uses the information in the application, i.e., inserts it into the database. To accomplish this, the syntactic parser first extracts the information out of each piece of the input; the pieces are then put directly into a tree structure that represents karyotype semantics. For insertion into the SKY database, the karyotype information is transformed into ASN.1 structures that reflect the design of the database.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							One of the most intensely studied regions of the human genome is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a group of genes that occupies approximately 46 megabases on the short arm of chromosome 6. The MHC genes, known in humans as Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, are highly polymorphic and encode molecules involved in the immune response. The MHC database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mhc" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbMHC</ext-link>, was designed to provide a neutral platform where the HLA community can submit, edit, view, and exchange MHC data. It currently consists of an interactive Alignment Viewer for HLA and related genes, an MHC microsatellite database (dbMHCms), a sequence interpretation site for Sequencing Based Typing (SBT), and a Primer/Probe database. dbMHC staff are in the process of creating a new database that will house a wide variety of HLA data including:

						<title>Introduction</title>
						<p>
							The most important known function of HLA genes is the presentation of processed peptides (antigens) to T cells, although there are many genes in the HLA region yet to be characterized, and work continues to locate and analyze new genes in and around the MHC (
							14). The vast amount of work required to elucidate the MHC led to a series of International Histocompatibility Workshop/Conferences (IHWCs). These conferences were the genesis for the IHWG, a group of researchers actively involved in projects that lead to shared data resources for the HLA community (
							516). dbMHC is a permanent public archive that was conceived by the IHWG and is implemented and hosted by NCBI. This database is intended to be expandable; if you have ideas for additional resources, please send an email to 
							<email>helmberg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The staff of the MHC database are currently accepting online submissions for the Primer/Probe/Mix component of dbMHC. Submissions can include typing data from any of the following: Sequence Specific Oligonucleotides (SSOs), Sequence Specific Primers (SSPs), SSO and/or SSP mixes, HLA typing kits, and Sequencing Based Typing (SBT). dbMHC allows submitters to edit their submissions online at any time.

It offers an interactive display of the alignment, where users can select alleles, highlight SNPs within the alignment, and change between a Codon display and a Decade display (blocks of 10 nucleotides). Users can also switch the type of display, from one where the sequence is completely written out to one where only the differences between selected sequences and a pre-selected reference sequence are seen. All sequences displayed in the Alignment Viewer can be downloaded and formatted as alignment, FASTA, or XML. If the    Alignment option is selected, it is up to the user to define how the alignment should be organized. The    Alignment option allows the user to download the entire alignment, or just a section of it, and also allows the user to specify how the sequence will be displayed (e.g., in groups of 10 nucleotides or amino acids).

Sequence can be submitted to the SBT interface by copying and pasting or by uploading from a file, either as haploid strands or heterozygote sequence. The current format restricts input to text or FASTA-formatted sequence.
							</p>
							<p>
								Submitted sequences are aligned to reference locus sequences located in the dbMHC allele database based on a user-defined degree of nucleotide mismatch. After a brief analysis, the SBT interface will display exons, introns, and untranslated regions for each sequence. Allele assignments are listed according to matching order. Mismatched nucleotide positions are listed separately (in the lower frame of the SBT interface) after selecting    Alignment . Note that the SBT interface analyzes one or more sequences for a single locus. If sequences from multiple loci that have identical group-specific amplifications are submitted, the SBT interface must be used to analyze sequences from only one locus at a time.

								<title>Primer/Probe Interface</title>
								<p>
									The Primer/Probe Interface provides information on individual reagents used for the typing of MHC or MHC-related loci. Users can access this information through the multiple functional frames within the interface. The words primers and probes represent SSOs, SSPs, SSP mixes, SSO mixes, and their combinations, which include nested PCR or SSO hybridization on group-specific amplifications. Nested PCR and group-specific amplification are both based on a primary amplification with an SSP mix.

							<sec id="bid.1804">
								<title>Selection of Primers/Probes</title>
								<p>
									The process of selecting a primer/probe begins by entering information in the upper frame of the Primer/Probe Interface page. Users enter search options for primers, probes, and mixes, which are grouped by type (SSO, SSP, SSO mix, and SSP mix), locus, and source (submitting institution). Primers/probes can also be selected by entering either the global or local name into the search field. Once this information is entered, the lower frame fills in with the Primer/Probe Listing. Primers/probes that are then selected by the user within the Primer/Probe Listing will be displayed in the large scroll box (in the upper frame) and can be downloaded in XML format.

									Within the primer/probe edit frame, there is an alternative input field for primer/probe sequence called Allele Sequence. If primer or probe orientation is set to reverse, the Allele Sequence field will reverse complement the allele sequence as displayed in the alignment to generate the appropriate primer/probe sequence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before submitting primer/probe data, a user should define the matching stringency of the primer or probe in the Annealing Stringency field. Once the user has selected the matching stringency, the probe can be submitted. Submission of a primer/probe triggers dbMHC to begin an allele reactivity calculation that is based on the primer/probe sequence and the selected matching stringency. The result of this calculation is a list of alleles that might be detected by the submitted primer/probe. The user will find this detectable allele list in the Reactive Allele Listing (lower frame).

									<title>Setting allele reactivity scores.</title>
									<p>
										A submitter can set individual allele reactivity scores either one-by-one or in a batch. The allele reactivity score for all alleles or for individual alleles that are unedited can be set the same as dbMHC's proposed allele reactivity score.
									</p>
									<p>
										If the user chooses to set the reactivity score as a batch, be aware that alleles within the batch that are not currently displayed will be scored as well. If the user makes a mistake in the scoring,  Reset will reset the reactivity scores to the values present at the beginning of the session.
									</p>
									<p> Submit stores the edited scores in the database. Once submitted, allele reactivity scores cannot be automatically reset to their prior value.
									</p>
									<p>
										Submitting allele reactivity scores will trigger a new dbMHC allele reactivity calculation. If the submitted primer/probe sequence is shorter than 10 nucleotides, dbMHC will use the score information of the alleles to extend the probe sequence.

									Selecting  Aligned from the Primer/Probe View results in a display of the reactive allele alignment in the lower frame of the Primer/Probe Interface. It displays the alleles that might be detected by a certain primer/probe or mix in alignment with that primer/probe sequence. By default, the first 20 alleles detected by the primer/probe or mix will be displayed. The frame for the reactive allele alignment also allows a submitter to set or edit the Allele Reactivity Score of a primer/probe in this frame. If a submitter chooses to not set a reactivity score, then dbMHC sets the submitter reactivity score to not edited. dbMHC will also calculate a system reactivity score for the primer/probe based on the primer/probe sequence and matching stringency. Colored option boxes indicate dbMHC's reactivity score for the primer/probe, whereas dots within the option boxes indicate the submitter's reactivity score. If the submitter's score (see Box 5) is set and differs from dbMHC's score, the dbMHC score box changes to a warning color.

An order number represents each element of a typing kit. This number provides a link to the probe reactivity alignment view of each element. The display also indicates whether, and for which elements, an allele-specific amplification has been used. Reactivity patterns can be entered either as a string or via the graphical display. Both the graphical display and the text field will update each other. The string entry accepts 1, + for positive reactivity, 0,- for negative reactivity, n for not tested, w for weak reactivity, and ? for undetermined. The graphic entry symbols are green for positive reactivity, orange for weak reactivity, yellow for undetermined, white for negative reactivity, and gray for not tested. Users can preset the main reactivity by selecting one reactivity option and clicking on  Set All . If the option  cycle has been selected, repeated clicking on one reactivity field of a kit will cycle through all possible reactivities.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reactivity string or pattern entered will be interpreted as a heterozygote allele combination. Multiple kits can be combined. Users can set the degree of tolerance, which limits the number of false-positive or false-negative reactivities per locus. Each locus is analyzed separately. Allele assignments for each locus are listed according to the number of false-positive/false-negative reactivities.

									Selecting  Pattern from the Typing Kit Interface results in a display (in the lower frame) of a cross-tab view of allele reactivities of an individual typing kit. Alleles are listed in rows, and kit elements are listed in columns. Each element of a typing kit is represented by the respective order number. This number provides a link to the probe reactivity alignment view of each element. The display also indicates whether and for which elements an allele-specific amplification has been used.
								</p>
								<p>
									A + with a green background signals a detection of an allele by a kit element, a w with an orange background signals a weak detection, a ? with a yellow background signals a lack of information, and an r with a red background signals a rejected interaction, although originally suggested by the prediction algorithm. If a kit is designed to detect only a subset of alleles, the display will be limited to this subset (see Box 9).

							<title>Primer/Probe Database</title>
							<p>
								dbMHC's primer/probe database or interface is not curated. As such, the accuracy of the information presented in this database is dependent entirely upon the accuracy of the data submitted to dbMHC.
							</p>
							<p>
								We suggest that each primer or probe submitted should be characterized by its complete sequence. In cases where submission of the complete sequence is impossible because the sequence information is considered proprietary, dbMHC offers the option to submit partial sequences. Submitted primer/probe specifications should comply with American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) (  20) and European Federation of Immunogenetics (EFI) (  21) standards for primers/probes used in histocompatibility DNA testing. If the submitted sequence contains fewer than 10 nucleotides, the submitter must also provide the position of the 3' end of the probe within the alignment of a locus. This additional information is necessary because the likelihood of a primer/probe reactivity calculation producing multiple erroneous alignment positions becomes too great if dbMHC calculates it with fewer than 10 nucleotides.

							<title>Reagent Allele Reactivity Prediction</title>
							<p>
								The allele reactivity prediction tool for primers and probes available through dbMHC presents calculations based solely on sequence similarity and can therefore offer only suggestions for the possible allele reactivities of individual primers and probes. Users should not consider this tool to be 100% accurate. A reliable prediction of primer/probe allele reactivities requires complete sequence information, as well as reaction data that include annealing temperature and magnesium concentration. Because these data are not consistently available to dbMHC, we are unable to offer more than a suggestion for primer/probe allele reactivity.

							<title>Computation of Primer/ProbeAllele Interaction Stringency</title>

								dbMHC uses sequence comparisons to create a sequence interaction match or stringency grade that is compiled within a penalizing system. dbMHC's starting point for grading the interaction between a primer/probe and an allele is 100%, with each difference in sequence between the primer/probe and the allele causing a reduction in the remaining match grade by a certain percentage. The primary factors dbMHC uses to compute stringency grading include:

										<title>Match score calculation for SSO probes.</title>
										<p>
											A 20-mer SSO anneals to a mismatched DNA. Both probe and template are shown in the sense orientation. The substitution of T with C leads to the probe-template mismatch T-G with a penalty of 0.42 (refer to   Table 2).
										</p>
										<p>
											This position has a 70% influence on the overall probe reactivity.
										</p>
										<p>
											The overall probe score is 1  (0.7  0.42) = 0.71.
										</p>
									</table-wrap-foot>
								</table-wrap>
								<p>
									dbMHC uses a penalty system based on nucleotide position in its calculation of SSO/SSP interactions with different alleles. The system dbMHC uses indicates the extent to which an individual nucleotide position will affect the interaction stringency grade in a worst-case scenario, where guanines are in opposing sequence positions or cytosines are in opposing sequence positions. The maximum penalty given in the system is in the middle of an SSO and at the 3' end of an SSP, as shown in Tables 3and 
									4.
								</p>
								<p>
									If the initial interaction stringency grade for a particular primer/probeallele interaction is 100% and a mismatch occurs in a position that carries a penalty of 100%, then dbMHC will reduce the interaction stringency grade to 0%. If the mismatch occurs in a position that carries a penalty of 95%, dbMHC will reduce the interaction stringency grade to 5%. A more detailed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mhc/html/annealinghelp.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">example</ext-link>of how dbMHC computes primer/probe interaction stringency is available online.
								</p>
								<p>
									dbMHC's reactive allele alignment algorithm searches for sequences with a match grade above the stringency level set by the submitter of each probe. Currently, the search algorithm searches within all loci that are part of dbMHC. Within each locus, the algorithm constructs compound sequences that represent the combined polymorphic positions of alleles of the same length. Alleles with insertions or deletions are handled separately. If a primer or probe matches with a certain position within the compound, all contributing alleles are checked for that position, whether or not they match.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reactive allele alignment algorithm will check within a specified locus for sequences that have a match grade in accordance with primer/probe specifications at a user-indicated position. The algorithm then extends SSPs toward the 5' end of the probe, to a maximum of 10 nucleotides, and extends both sides of SSOs a maximum of 15 nucleotides, observing all polymorphic positions in matching alleles. The resulting probe extension is then used by the alignment algorithm to check for cross-reactivities within other loci.
								</p>
								<p>
									If the submitted primer/probe sequence is shorter than 10 nucleotides and the user submits a score that accepts certain alleles and rejects others, the reactive allele alignment algorithm will use this information to refine the probe extension. If the probe submitter rejects all alleles containing a unique sequence motif in the vicinity of the probe sequence, the algorithm will generate the extended probe sequence such that it does not match the unique sequence motif.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							Sequin is a stand-alone sequence record editor, designed for preparing new sequences for submission to GenBank and for editing existing records. Sequin runs on the most popular computer platforms found in biology laboratories, including PC, Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux. It can handle a wide range of sequence lengths and complexities, including entire chromosomes and large datasets from population or phylogenetic studies. Sequin is also used within NCBI by the GenBank and Reference Sequence indexers for routine processing of records before their release.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sequin has a modular construction, which simplifies its use, design, and implementation. Sequin relies on many components of the NCBI Toolkit and thus acts as a quality assurance that these functions are working properly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Detailed information on how to use Sequin to submit records to GenBank or edit sequence records can be found in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/QuickGuide/sequin.htm" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sequin Quick Guide</ext-link>. Although this chapter will make frequent reference to that help document, the focus will be mostly on the underlying concepts and software components upon which Sequin is built.
						</p>

					<lesson  id="lesson539">
						<title>Sequin: A Brief Overview</title>
						<p>
							As input, Sequin takes a biological sequence(s) from a scientist wanting to submit or edit sequence data. The sequence (or set of sequences) can be new information that has not yet been assigned a GenBank Accession number, or it can be an existing GenBank sequence record. If Sequin is being used to submit a sequence(s) to GenBank, then the scientist is prompted to include his/her contact information, information about other authors, and the sequence, at the start of the submission process. Once all the necessary information has been entered, it is then possible to view the sequence in a variety of displays and edit it using Sequin's suite of editing tools.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sequin is designed for use by people with different levels of expertise. Thus, it has several built-in functions that can, for example, ensure that a new user submits a valid sequence record to GenBank, or it can be prompted to automatically generate a sequence definition line. At the other end of the scale, for computer-literate users, Sequin can be customized by the addition of more (perhaps research-specific) analysis functions. Furthermore, there are some extremely powerful functions built into Sequin that are only available to NCBI Indexing staff. These are switched off by default in the public download version of Sequin because they include the ability to make the kinds of changes to a sequence record that can also completely destroy it, if handled incorrectly. These various built-in Sequin functions are discussed further below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sequin's versatility is based on its design: (<italic>a</italic>) Sequin holds the sequence(s) being manipulated in memory, in a structured format that allows a rapid response to the commands initiated by the person who is using Sequin; and (<italic>b</italic>) it makes use of many standard functions found in the NCBI Toolkitfor both basic data manipulations and as components of Sequin-specific tasks. In particular, Sequin makes heavy use of the Toolkit's object manager, a behind the scenes support system that keeps track of Sequin's internal data structures and the relationships of each piece of information to others. This allows many of Sequin's functions to operate independently of each other, making data manipulation much faster and making the program easier to maintain.

						<title>Sequence Submission</title>
						<p>
							Sequin is used to edit and submit sequences to GenBank and handles a wide range of sequence lengths and complexities. After <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/download.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">downloading</ext-link>and installing Sequin, a scientist wanting to submit or edit a sequence(s) is led through a series of forms to input information about the sequence to be submitted. The forms are smart, and different forms will appear, customized to the type of submission. Detailed information on how to fill in these forms can be found within the  Help feature of the Sequin application itself and in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/QuickGuide/sequin.htm" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">online Help</ext-link>documents.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sequin expects sequence data in FASTAformatted files, which should be prepared as plain text before uploading them into Sequin. Population, phylogenetic, and mutation studies can also be entered in PHYLIP, NEXUS, MACAW, or  formats.
						</p>
						<p>
							A sequence in FASTA format consists of a definition line, which starts with a &gt;, and the sequence itself, which starts on a new line directly below the definition line. The definition line should contain the name or identifier of the sequence but may also include other useful information. In the case of nucleotides, the name of the source organism and strain should be included; for proteins, it is useful to include the gene and protein names. Given all this information, Sequin can automatically assemble a record suitable for inclusion in GenBank (see below). Detailed information on how to prepare FASTA files for Sequin can be found in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/QuickGuide/sequin.htm#before" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Quick Guide</ext-link>.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.541">
							<title>Single Sequences</title>
							<p>
								For single nucleotide sequence submissions to GenBank, the submitter supplies Sequin with the nucleotide sequence and any translated protein sequence(s). For example, a submission consisting of a nucleotide from mouse strain BALB/c that contains the -hemoglobin gene, encoding the adult major chain -hemoglobin protein, would have two sequences with the following definition lines, where BALB23g and BALB23p are nucleotide and protein IDs provided by the submitter: 
								<preformat>
									&gt; BALB23g [organism=Mus musculus] [strain=BALB/c]   &gt; BALB23p [gene=Hbb-b1] [protein=hemoglobin, beta adult major chain]
								</preformat>
							</p>
							<p>
								The organism name is essential to make a legal GenBank   flatfile. It can be included in the definition line as shown above, for the convenience of the submitter, or one of the Sequin submission forms will prompt for its clarity.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although it is not necessary to include a protein translation with the nucleotide submission, scientists are strongly encouraged to do so because this, along with the source organism information, enables Sequin to automatically calculate the coding region (  CDS) on the nucleotide being submitted. Furthermore, with gene and protein names properly annotated, the record becomes informative to other scientists who may retrieve it through a   BLASTor   Entrezsearch (see also   Chapter 15and   Chapter 16).
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.542">
							<title>Segmented Nucleotide Sets</title>
							<p>
								A segmented nucleotide entry is a set of non-contiguous sequences that has a defined order and orientation. For example, a genomic DNA segmented set could include encoding exons along with fragments of their flanking introns. An example of an mRNA segmented pair of records would be the 5 and 3 ends of an mRNA where the middle region has not been sequenced. To import nucleotides in a segmented set, each individual sequence must be in FASTA format with an appropriate definition line, and all sequences should be in the same file.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.543">
							<title>High-Throughput Genomic Sequences</title>
							<p>
								Genome Sequencing Centers use automated sequencing machines to rapidly produce large quantities of unfinished DNA sequence, called high-throughput genomic sequence (  HTGS). These sequences are not usually annotated with any features, such as coding regions, at all, and in the initial phases are not of high (finished) quality.
							</p>
							<p>
								The sequencing machines produce intensity traces for the four fluorescent dyes that correspond to the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Software such as   PHREDand   PHRAPconvert these raw traces into the sequence letters A, C, G, or T. PHRED is a base-calling program that reads the sequences of the DNA fragments and produces a quality score. With multiple overlapping reads to work on, PHRAP assembles the DNA fragments using the quality scores of PHRED, itself producing a quality score for each base. The resulting file, which PHRAP outputs in .ace format, consists of the sequence itself plus the associated quality scores. Sequin can use these files as input and assemble valid GenBank records from them. Further information on using Sequin to prepare a HTGS record can be found   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/sequininfo.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">here</ext-link>.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.544">
							<title>Feature Tables</title>
							<p>
								Some Genome Centers now analyze their sequences and record the base positions of a number of sequence features such as the gene, mRNA, or coding regions. Sequin can capture this information and include it in a GenBank submission as long as it is formatted correctly in a   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">feature table</ext-link>. Sequin can read a simple, five-column, tab-delimited file in which the first and second columns are the start and stop locations of the feature, respectively, the third column is the type of feature (the feature keygene, mRNA, CDS, etc.), the fourth column is the qualifier name (e.g., product), and the fifth the qualifier value (e.g., the name of the protein or gene). The features for an entire bacterial genome can be read in seconds using  this format. A sample features table is shown below. 
								<preformat>
									&gt;Feature sde3g   240 4048 gene gene SDE3   240 1361 mRNA   1450 1614   1730 3184   3275 4048 product RNA helicase SDE3   579 1361 CDS   1450 1614   1730 3184   3275 3880 product RNA helicase SDE3
								</preformat>
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.545">
							<title>Alignments</title>
							<p>
								Population, phylogenetic, and mutation studies all involve the alignment of a number of sequences with each other so that regions of sequence similarity are emphasized. Sometimes it is necessary to introduce gaps into the sequences to give the best alignment. Sequin reads several output formats from sequence and phylogenetic analysis programs, including PHYLIP, NEXUS, PAUP, or FASTA+GAP.
							</p>
							<p>
								The submitted sequence alignment represents the relationship between sequences. This inferred relationship allows Sequin to propagate features annotated on one sequence to the equivalent positions on the remaining sequences in the alignment. Feature propagation is one of the many editing functions possible in Sequin. Using this tool significantly reduces the time required to annotate an alignment submission.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1767">
							<title>Automated Submission</title>
							<p>
								tbl2asn is a program that automates the submission of sequence records to GenBank. It uses many of the same functions as Sequin but is driven entirely by data files, and records need no additional manual editing before submission. Entire genomes, consisting of many chromosomes with feature annotation, can be processed in seconds using this method.

						<title>Packaging the Submissions</title>
						<p>
							Sequences given to Sequin in the input data formats described in this chapter are retained within Sequin memory, allowing them to be manipulated in real time. For example, for submission to GenBank, the sequence is transformed from the Sequin internal structure to Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1), the data description language in which GenBank records are stored. This is the format transmitted over the Internet when submitting to GenBank. Sequin can also output information in other formats, such as GenBank flatfile or XML, for saving to a local file.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most sequence submissions are packaged into a BioseqSet, which contains one or more sequences (Bioseqs), along with supporting information that has been included by the submitter, such as source organism, type of molecule, sequence length, and so on (Figure 1). There are different classes of BioseqSets; thus, a simple single nucleotide submission is called a nuc-prot set (a BioseqSet of class nuc-prot) containing the nucleotide and protein Bioseqs. Similarly, population, phylogenetic, and mutation sequences, along with alignments, are packaged into BioseqSets of classes pop-set, phy-set, and mut-set, respectively. The alignment information is extracted into a Seq-align, which is packaged as annotation (Seq-annot) associated with the BioseqSet. In the case of PHRAP quality scores, these are converted into a Seq-graph, which, similar to alignment information, is packaged in a Seq-annot; however, in this case it is associated with the nucleotide sequence and not the higher-level BioseqSet. The Seq-graph of PHRAP scores can be displayed in Sequin's Graphical view.

									<p>
										The display can be understood as a Venn diagram. Selecting the up or down arrow expands or contracts, respectively, the level of detail shown. In a typical submission of a protein-coding gene, a BioseqSet (of class nuc-prot) contains two Bioseqs, one for the nucleotide and one for the protein. Descriptors, such as BioSrc, can be packaged on the set and thus apply to all Bioseqs within the set. Features allow annotation on specific regions of a sequence. For example, the CDS location provides instructions to translate the DNA sequence into the protein product.

							</fig>
						</p>
						<p>
							Features are usually packaged on the sequence indicated by their location. For example, the gene feature is packaged on the nucleotide Bioseq, and a protein feature is packaged on the protein Bioseq. Proteins are real sequences, and features such as mature peptides are annotated on the proteins in protein coordinates (although they can be mapped to nucleotide coordinates for display in a GenBank flatfile). A CDS (coding region) feature location points to the nucleotide, but the feature product points to the protein. For historical reasons, the CDS is usually packaged on the nuc-prot set instead of on the nucleotide sequence.

						<p>
							After the record has been constructed, the features can be viewed in a variety of display formats (Table 1). These include the traditional GenBank or GenPept flatfiles, a graphical overview, the feature spans displayed over the actual sequence letters, and ASN.1. These formats are generated by components of the NCBI Toolkit.
						</p>
						<p>
							The different format generators all work independently from one another. When Sequin starts up, it registers a set of function procedures used to generate each display format. While issuing Sequin commands during manipulation of the sequence, appropriate messages (for example, generate the view from the internal sequence record, highlight this feature, export the view to the clipboard, etc.) are sent to the viewer by calling one of these procedures. Separate lists of registered formats are maintained for nucleotide, protein, and genome record types.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just as the different format generators do not need to know about each other, Sequin's viewer windows do not need to know about other Sequin viewer or editor windows that are active at the same time. When editing a sequence, the user may have several different views of the same sequence open at the same time (for example, a GenBank flatfile and a graphical view). Clicking on a feature in the graphical view will select the same feature in the GenBank flatfile, and double-clicking on a feature launches the specific editor for that feature. This type of communication between different windows is orchestrated by the NCBI Toolkit's object manager.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.550">
							<title>The Sequence Editor</title>
							<p>
								The sequence editor is used like a text editor, with new sequence added at the position of the cursor. Furthermore, the sequence editor automatically adjusts the biological feature intervals as editing proceeds. For example, if 60 bases are pasted or typed onto the 5 end of a sequence record, the sequence editor will shift all the features by 60 bases. This means that interval correction does not need to be done by hand. Prior to Sequin, it was usually easier to resubmit from scratch than to edit all of the feature intervals manually.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.551">
							<title>The Feature Editors</title>
							<p>
								Feature editor windows have a common structure, organized by tabs (Figures 24). The first tab is for elements specific to the given feature (  Figure 2). For example, in a coding region editor, the first tab has controls for entering the coding region and reading frame. The second tab is for elements common to all sequence features (  Figure 3). These include an exception flag, which allows explanations to be given for unusual events (e.g., RNA editing or non-consensus splice sites) and a comment (a free-text statement shown as /note in the flatfile). The last tab is a location spreadsheet allowing multiple feature intervals to be entered (  Figure 4). For a coding region, these would reflect the boundaries of the exons used to encode the protein.

						<title>Computational Functions of Sequin</title>
						<p>
							Sequin combines several NCBI Toolkit functions to perform many useful computations on the data in Sequin's memory.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.554">
							<title>Automatic Annotation of Coding Regions</title>
							<p>
								When a nucleotide is submitted to GenBank using Sequin, it is essential to give the name of the source organism.  The submitter is also strongly encouraged to supply the translated protein sequence(s) for the nucleotide.
							</p>
							<p>
								Supplying the organism name allows Sequin to automatically find and use the correct genetic code for translating the nucleotide sequence to protein for the most frequently sequenced organisms. On the basis of only the genetic code and sequences of the nucleotide and protein products, Sequin will then calculate the location of the protein-coding region(s) on the nucleotide sequence. This is an extremely powerful function of Sequin. The ability to do this automatically, instead of by hand, has made sequence submission much faster and less error-prone.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sequin uses a reverse translating alignment algorithm, called Suggest Intervals, to locate the protein-coding region(s) on the nucleotide sequence. The algorithm builds a table of the positions of all possible stretches of three amino acids in the protein. It then translates the nucleotide in all six reading frames and searches for a match to one of these triplets. When it finds one, it attempts to extend the match on each side of the initial hit. If the extension hits a mismatch or an intron, it stops. Given these candidate regions of matching, Sequin then tries to find the best set of other identical regions that will generate a complete protein. While doing this, the algorithm takes   splice sitesinto account when deciding where to start an intron in eukaryotic sequences and fuses regions split by a single amino acid mismatch.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.555">
							<title>Updating Sequence Records</title>
							<p>
								The ability to propagate features through an alignment and the way the sequence editor can adjust feature positions as the sequence is edited are combined in Sequin to provide a simple and automatic method for updating an existing sequence.
							</p>
							<p>
								The    Update Sequence function allows overlapping sequence or a replacement sequence to be included in an existing sequence record. Sequin makes an alignment (using the BLAST functions in the NCBI Toolkit), merges the sequence if necessary, and propagates features onto the new sequence in the new positions. This effectively replaces the old sequence and features. The    Update Sequence function is based on the NCBI Toolkit's alignment indexing, which allows Sequin to produce several displays that help the user to confirm that the correct sequence is in fact being processed (  Figure 5).  
								<fig id="bid.556">
									<label>
										5
									</label>
									<caption>
										<title>The Update Sequence window.</title>
										<p>
											The   <italic>top panel</italic>shows the overall relationship between the two sequences, including the parts that align and any parts that do not align. From these data, Sequin determines whether the user is updating with a 5 overlap, 3 overlap, or full replacement sequence, and it presets radio buttons to indicate the relationship. The   <italic>second panel</italic>shows a simple graphical view of the positions of gaps and base mismatches in the old and new sequences. The   <italic>third panel</italic>shows the same information but with the actual sequence letters. Clicking on the second panel scrolls to the same place in the third panel.
										</p>

									<graphic mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="ch12f5" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
								</fig>
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.557">
							<title>The Validator</title>
							<p>
								The final version of the sequence, complete with all the annotated features, can be checked using the validator. This function checks for consistency and for the presence of required information for submission to GenBank. The validator searches for missing organism information, incorrect coding-region lengths (compared to the submitted protein sequence), internal stop codons in coding regions, mismatched amino acids, and non-consensus splice sites. Double-clicking on an item in the error report launches an editor on the offending feature. The NCBI Toolkit has a program (testval), which is a stand-alone version of the validator.
							</p>
							<p>
								The validator also checks for inconsistency between nucleotide and protein sequences, especially in coding regions, the protein product, and the protein feature on the product. For example, if the coding region is marked as incomplete at the 5 end, the protein product and protein feature should be marked as incomplete at the amino end. (Unless told otherwise, the CDS editor will automatically synchronize these anomalies, facilitating the correction of this kind of inconsistency.)
							</p>
							<p>
								Additional checks include ensuring that all features are annotated within the range of the sequence, all feature location intervals are noted on the same DNA strand, tRNA codons conform to the given genetic code, and that there are no duplicate features or different genes with the same names. The validator even checks that the sequence letters are valid for the indicated alphabet (e.g., the letter E may appear in proteins but not in nucleotides).
							</p>
							<p>
								In cases where an exception has been flagged in a feature editor, specific validator tests can be disabled. For example, if the reason given for an exception is RNA editing, this turns off CDS translation checking in the validator. Likewise, ribosomal slippage disables exon splice checking, and trans splicing suppresses the error message that usually appears when feature intervals are indicated on different DNA strands.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.559">
							<title>Automatic Definition Line Generator</title>
							<p>
								NCBI has a preferred format for the definition line in the GenBank format. It starts with the organism name, then the names of the protein products of coding regions (with the gene name in parentheses), with complete or partial at the end: 
								<preformat>
									DEFINITION Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 isolate ES-TMD envelopeglycoprotein (env) gene, partial cds.
								</preformat>
							</p>
							<p>
								There is also a standard style for explaining alternative splice products. Sequin's Automatic Definition Line Generator collects CDS, RNA, and exon features in the order that they appear on the nucleotide sequence, finds the relevant genes (usually by location overlap), and prepares a definition line that conforms to GenBank policy.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.560">
							<title>Recalculation of Multiple CDS Features</title>
							<p>
								In spite of all the safeguards built into Sequin, a submitter sometimes uses an incorrect genetic code for an organism. This means that the protein products of CDS translations may be incorrect. Sequin can retranslate all CDS features with a single command. Even so, if the sequence being edited is large, for example, a whole chromosome, this can be a time-consuming operation. To speed it up, the NCBI Toolkit uses a finite state machine (an efficient pattern search algorithm) for rapid translation. The machine is primed with a given genetic code, and then nucleotide sequence letters are fed into the algorithm one at a time, in the order they appear in the sequence. This allows all six frames (three frames on each strand) to be translated in the least possible time. The    Open Reading Frame search in the NCBI Toolkit's tbl2asn program also uses this function.

						<title>Advanced Topics</title>
						<sec id="bid.1653">
							<title>The Special Menu</title>
							<p>
								The Special Menu of Sequin encompasses a powerful set of tools that are available to GenBank and Reference Sequence indexers only. The Special Menu is not available to the public in the standard release because without a thorough understanding of the NCBI Data Model, use of the functions can cause irreparable damage to a record. It allows indexers to globally edit features, qualifiers, or descriptors in all sequences in a record, so that the same correction does not have to be made at each occurrence of the error. For example, all CDS features with internal stop codons can be converted to pseudogenes. Another common error made by submitters is to enter a repeat unit (a rpt_unit; e.g., ATTGG) in the repeat-type field (a rpt_type; e.g., tandem repeat). The Special Menu allows indexing staff to convert rpt_type to rpt_unit throughout the record.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1654">
							<title>NCBI Desktop Window</title>
							<p>
								Although Sequin has editors for changing specific fields and Special Menu functions for doing bulk changes on several features, it is not possible to anticipate all of the manipulations NCBI indexers might need to do to clean up a problem record. The NCBI Desktop window shows the internal structure of a record (  Figure 1), i.e., how Bioseqs are packaged within Bioseq-sets, and where features, alignments, graphs, and descriptors are packaged on the sequences or sets. Objects (sets, sequences, features, etc.) can be dragged out of the record or moved to a different place in the record. Such manipulations could break the validity of the sequence record; therefore, great care must be taken when using it.
							</p>
							<p>
								For technically adept Sequin users, the Desktop is where additional analysis functions can be added to Sequin without building a complicated user interface. With a feature or sequence selected, items in the Filter menu perform specific analyses on the selected objects. The standard filters include reverse, complement, and reverse complement of a sequence, and reverse complement of a sequence and all of its features. These are needed to repair the occasional record that came in on the wrong strand or in 35 direction. Adding new filter functions requires adding code to one of the Sequin source code files (one is provided with no other code in it for this purpose) and recompiling the program.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1655">
							<title>Network Analysis Functions</title>
							<p>
								The functions of Sequin can be expanded by the addition of a configuration file that specifies the URLs for other programs (CGI scripts) available from the Internet. For example,   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/tRNAscan-SE/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">tRNAscan-SE</ext-link>, a program by Sean Eddy and colleagues at Washington University (St. Louis, MO), can be used on sequences in Sequin in this way.
							</p>
							<p>
								At a minimum, the CGI should be able to read FASTA format and should return either sequence data or the five-column feature table (discussed above) as its result. The external programs that Sequin knows about appear in the    Analysis menu. When one of these analyses is triggered, Sequin sends a message to the URL and checks for the result with a timer so that the user can continue to work while the (Web) server is processing the request. The code for the CGI that chaperones data from Sequin to tRNAscan-SE and converts the tRNAscan results to a five-column feature table is in the demo directory of the public NCBI Toolkit.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1656">
							<title>Network Fetch Functions</title>
							<p>
								As sequencing of complete bacterial genomes and eukaryotic chromosomes becomes more commonplace, the demand to break up long sequences into more manageable bites has increased (although Sequin is perfectly capable of editing these large records). Some genomes at NCBI are thus represented as segmented (or delta) Bioseqs, which are composed of pointers to other raw sequences in GenBank. Obtaining the entire sequence and all of the features requires fetching the individual components from a network service.
							</p>
							<p>
								The object manager allows Sequin to know about different fetch functions that can be used. When a sequence is needed, these functions will be called until one of them satisfies the request. For example, the lsqfetch configuration file can be edited to point to a directory containing sequence files on a user's disk. The SeqFetch function calls a network service at NCBI to obtain sequences and to look up Accession numbers given gi numbers or gi numbers given Accession numbers.
							</p>
							<p>
								When used internally by NCBI indexers, Sequin can also fetch records from the DirSub and TMSmart databases. To ensure the confidentiality of pre-released records, this access requires the indexer to have a database password and to be working from a computer within NCBI. For additional protection, the paths to the database scripts are stored in a configuration file and are not encoded in the public Sequin source code.

						<title>Conclusion</title>
						<p>
							Sequin has an important dual role as a primary submission tool and as a full-featured sequence record editor. It is designed to be modular on several levels, which simplifies the design and implementation of its components. Sequin sits at the top of the NCBI software Toolkit, relying on many of the underlying components, and thus acts as a quality assurance that these functions are working properly.

								The sequence database GenBank (Chapter 1) is made up of nucleotide sequences   submitted by individual scientists and sequencing centers from around the world. These sequences have been submitted directly to GenBank or are replicated from one of the collaborating databases,the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EMBL</ext-link>) Data Library or the DNA Data Bank of Japan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">DDBJ</ext-link>). Once processed, the data are made available for public use in several ways (Table 1). The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Entrez</ext-link>search and retrieval system (Chapter 14) can be used to find one or many sequences in GenBank by using text queries into fields that are linked to the raw sequence data, such as author, definition line, organism, and so on. The sequences themselves are searched directly by using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BLAST</ext-link>(Chapter 16), which takes a sequence as a query to find similar sequences. Large subsets or the latest, complete version of GenBank can also be downloaded by <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">FTP</ext-link>. Underlying the submission, storage, and access processes seen by users of GenBank, BLAST, and other curated data resources [such as the Reference Sequences (Chapter 18), the Map Viewer (Chapter 20), or LocusLink (Chapter 19)] is an information management system that consists of two major components, the ID database and the IQ database. Whereas ID handles incoming sequences and feeds other databases with subsets to suit different needs, IQ holds links between sequences from ID and links from these sequences to other resources. This chapter discusses these resources in more detail.

							<title>Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) Is the Data Format Used by the ID System</title>
							<p>
								ASN.1is the data description language in which all sequence data at NCBI are structured. ASN.1 allows a detailed description of both the sequences and the information associated with them, e.g., author names, source organism, and sequence features. Maintaining all of the data in the same structured format simplifies data parsing, manipulation, and quality assurance, as well as making data integration and the development of software for sequence analysis easier. All of the various divisions of GenBank can be downloaded in ASN.1 from the NCBI   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ncbi-asn1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">FTP site</ext-link>. Similar to an XML   DTD, ASN.1 has associated with it a description of the legal data structures; this file is called asn.all and is available by   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">FTP</ext-link>in the ASN directory from the file, ncbi.tar.Z. The DEMO directory of this same file contains the tool, testval, which validates the data against asn.all. There is also a set of utilities for producing ASN.1 while programming in C; these are largely in the subutil.c file of the API directory. In the ID data management system, data are stored as ASN.1 blob, minimizing the amount of biological information that needs be captured and updated in the relational database schema.

								The submission pathway depends on the data source (see   Figure 1) and volume. Generally, large-volume submitters, such as HTGS, use FTP, often after using tools such as fa2htgs to convert their data to ASN.1. Small-volume submitters typically use either BankIt (  Chapter 1) or Sequin (  Chapter 12) to prepare the ASN.1 for submission.
							</p>
							<p>
								The data received are subject to some quality control. The submission tools BankIt, Sequin, and fa2htgs have built-in validation mechanisms that ensure that the data submitted have the correct structure and contain the essential information. The work of the GenBank indexing staff, who also use Sequin, adds an additional layer of quality control and provides assistance with problems or complex submissions and updates.

							<title>The ID Database</title>
							<p>
								The ID database is a group of standard relational databases that holds both ASN.1 objects and sequence identifier-related information. ASN.1 objects follow the specifications in the asn.all file for NCBI sequence data objects. ID holds data for GenBank and other data, all of which are included in Entrez. All of the sequences for the International Nucleic Acid Database Collaboration are in GenBank and must have Accession numbers assigned to them. These Accession numbers define an entity, the sequence of which is described. When the understanding of that sequence changes, the sequence can have a new version. This leads to two parallel ways of tracking sequence versions for an object. In the GenBank flatfile format, there is an Accession.Version, where the version gives the ordinal instance (version) of the sequence. Within ID, each unique sequence is assigned a gi number; therefore, the chain of gi numbers for an Accession also gives all of the instances of the sequence for that Accession. The chain identifier within ID can be used to link these gi numbers. (Not all sequences within ID are in GenBank and not all have sequence versions, but all sequences have a chain of gi numbers. For this reason, internally, the gi number is the universal pointer to a particular sequence, as opposed to the Accession.Version, which would work only for versioned sequences.) The ID database is also the controller for allowed takeovers of one Accession by another. A takeover would occur, for example, when two clones' sequences were now to be merged into a single clone. One or both of the two older clones' Accessions could be taken over by the new clone. The actual details of the architecture of this group of databases and software associated with it are described later in this chapter.

							<title>Output of Data from the ID System</title>
							<p>
								Once all incoming data have been converted to ASN.1 format and have been entered into ID, the data are then replicated to several different servers and also transformed into several different formats (  Figure 2). The replication is necessary for a number of reasons: (1) it separates the incoming data system (ID) from the outgoing data, i.e., the data served in response to scientific queries by users; (2) replicating the data to different servers helps balance the load of queries, thus providing quicker response times, and allows different servers to specialize in different functions; and (3) it protects against data loss; having copies kept at different locations means that the data are safe, should one server fail.

							<title>The IQ Database</title>
							<p>
								The IQ database is a   Sybasedata-warehousing product that preserves its SQL language interface but inverts the data it stores so that the data are stored by column, not by row. Its strength is that it can speed up results from queries based on the anticipated indexing. This non-relational database holds links between many different objects.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, as part of the processing of incoming sequences, each protein and nucleotide sequence is searched (using BLAST,   Chapter 16) against the rest of the database for similar sequences. The resulting set of similar sequences (sometimes known as neighbors) are made available to users by selecting the    related sequences link next to a record in Entrez (  Chapter 15). The IQ database keeps track of the neighbors for any given sequence; these relationships are all precomputed to save time for the people using this feature.
							</p>
							<p>
								As well as storing the relationships between nucleotide or between proteins, IQ also holds information on the links between entries in different Entrez databases. This might include, for example, information on the publications cited within sequence records (which link to PubMed), or to an organism in the Taxonomy database. Some of this information comes from the analysis of the ASN.1 in ID by e2index.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.581">
							<title>The BLAST Control Database</title>
							<p>
								The BLAST Control database receives information from ID and uses it to generate BLAST databases (  Chapter 16) for the BLAST query service and for stand-alone BLAST users, as well as for internal use, to generate the sequence neighbors detailed in IQ.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.582">
							<title>The GenBank Flatfile and Error Capture Databases</title>
							<p>
								Many people who use NCBI services think of the GenBank flatfile as the archetypal sequence data format. However, in terms of the ID internal data flow system, ASN.1 is considered the original format from which reports such as the GenBank flatfile can be generated. Generally, the GenBank flatfile is generated on demand from the ASN.1. However, for certain products, such as complete GenBank releases, a GenBank flatfile image is made for each active sequence and is stored in a database called FF4Release, which consists of the latest transformation of ASN.1 to the GenBank flatfile format.
							</p>
							<p>
								This database also doubles as the place where internal error reports are captured. The reports can be analyzed and displayed for different time points in the data processing pathway: (  <italic>a</italic>) ASN.1 itself can be validated using the testval tool. (Syntax checking is not necessary, because the underlying ASN.1 libraries enforce proper syntax according to the definition file.); (  <italic>b</italic>) errors can be discovered during conversion to GenBank flatfile format; and (  <italic>c</italic>) through a reparse from GenBank flatfile format to ASN.1. This is done as a further check for legality of the ASN.1, and our current software for producing GenBank format reports from it.

								When sequences are submitted to GenBank or one of the collaborating databases, useful information about the sequence is often also included. This might include a brief description of a gene in the definition line, along with annotated sequence features, e.g., the source organism name. To make this information searchable via Entrez, these words have to be indexed. They are therefore extracted from the ASN.1 (using a tool called e2index) and are then stored in the Entrez posting files, which are optimized for Boolean queries by the Entrez system (see   Chapter 15).

						<title>Data Flow Architecture</title>
						<p>
							ID has a distributed architecture, the features of which are shown in Figure 3. The system is activated when a client (internal to NCBI) is ready to load data into the ID system. A stand-alone program takes ASN.1-containing files, while a client API can submit data to ID through the IDProdOS. The rationale behind the various architecture components is discussed below.
						</p>
						<p>
							IDProdOS is an open server (commonly called middleware), which sits between the clients and the database system. It hides details of the underlying complexity from the client API. For example, the previous version of the ID system consisted of a single database. Using the Open Server meant that when the conversion to the current system took place, only the open server had to be changed, and none of the clients. IDProdOS begins the complex process of checking that the actions implied by the load are allowed and changes the SeqId pointers to gi numbers to be used as sequence-specific pointers. For example, in a record that has DNA and protein sequences, including annotation and sequence identifiers, the identifier on the protein has to be unique. If the identifier has been used previously on another DNA sequence and the current sequence is not replacing the previous sequence, then this is not allowed because proteins are not allowed to move between GenBank records. As an exception, this rule is sometimes relaxed for proteins moving between segments of a complete genome submission.
						</p>
						<p>
							The IdMain database contains the sequence identifiers for each of the sequence records, including all those for ASN.1 blobs that contain multiple sequences. It enforces sequence version rules, among others.
						</p>
						<p>
							Relational satellite databases are fully normalized databases that hold records for which there is only one sequence per intended ASN.1 blob. Few, if any, features are allowed on records intended for relational satellite databases. (The PubSeqOS produces the ASN.1 by querying the relational tables.) This is in contrast to the Blob satellite databases, from which ASN.1 is retrieved pre-made.
						</p>
						<p>
							Blob satellite databases, although relational databases, contain ASN.1 objects as unnormalized data objects.
						</p>
						<p>
							The SnpAnnot database contains only feature information. It has simple mutation information from dbSNP (Chapter 5), which is added to NCBI-curated records by the PubSeqOS when the records are requested.
						</p>
						<p>
							To visualize the role of replication, the rectangle in the middle of Figure 3represents the use of the Sybase Replication Server to copy information from the loading side of the system to the query side.
						</p>
						<p>
							PubSeqOS is an open server (commonly called middleware) that sits between the clients and the database system. It hides details of the underlying complexity from the client API. It actually has an almost identical code base to IDProdOS because it serves similar functions. When the ASN.1 that has been requested is to be presented in a format other than ASN.1, psansconvert is called to do the conversion. This separate process allows both insulation from any possible instability and allows for use of multiple central processing unit in a natural way.
						</p>
						<p>
							The EntrezControl and The Graveyards databases are uniquely on the query side. The EntrezControl database controls information on records that await indexing and have been indexed by e2index.The Graveyards are blob databases and contain those blobs killed by replacement or that were taken over by other blobs. Once taken over, blobs are not changed; therefore, they need not be on the loading side.

							<title>Annotation of other genomes.</title>
							<p>
								NCBI may assemble a genome prior to annotation, add annotations to a genome assembled elsewhere, or simply process an annotated genome to produce RefSeqs and maps for display in Map Viewer (  Chapter 20).
							</p>
							<p>
								The basic procedures used to annotate other eukaryotic genomes are essentially the same as those used to annotate the human genome. However, the overall process is adjusted to accommodate the different types of input data that are available for each organism. Genes can be annotated on any genome for which a significant number of mRNA, EST, or protein sequences are available. Other features, such as clones, STS markers, and SNPs, can also be annotated whenever the relevant data are available for an organism.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, genes and other features are placed on the mouse Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly from the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/credits.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium</ext-link>(MGSC) by skipping the assembly steps used in the human process but following the annotation steps with relatively minor adjustments. A variation of the human process is also used to assemble and annotate genomic contigs from finished mouse clone sequences (see the Map Viewer   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/maps.cgi?ORG=mouse&amp;chr=1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">display</ext-link>of the mouse genome).
							</p>
						</boxed-text>
						<p>
							The primary data produced by genome sequencing projects are often highly fragmented and sparsely annotated. This is especially true for the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10001772" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Human Genome Project</ext-link>as a result of its policy of releasing sequence data to the public sequence databases every day (
							1, 
							2). So that individual researchers do not have to piece together extended segments of a genome and then relate the sequence to genetic maps and known genes, NCBI provides annotated assemblies of public genome sequence data. NCBI assimilates data of various types, from numerous sources, to provide an integrated view of a genome, making it easier for researchers to spot informative relationships that might not have been apparent from looking at the primary data. The annotated genomes can be explored using Map Viewer (Chapter 20) to display different types of data side-by-side and to follow links between related pieces of data.
						</p>
						<p>
							This chapter describes the series of steps, the pipeline, that produces NCBI's annotated genome assembly from data deposited in the public sequence databases. A variant of the annotation process developed for the human genome is used to annotate the mouse genome, and similar procedures will be applied to other genomes (Box 1).
						</p>
						<p>
							NCBI constantly strives to improve the accuracy of its human genome assembly and annotation, to make the data displays more informative, and to enhance the utility of our access tools. Each run through the assembly and annotation procedure, together with feedback from outside groups and individual users, is used to improve the process, refine the parameters for individual steps, and add new features. Consequently, the details of the assembly and annotation process change from one run to the next. This chapter, therefore, describes the overall human genome assembly and annotation process and provides short descriptions of the key steps, but it does not detail specific procedures or parameters. However, sufficient detail is provided to enable users of our assembly and annotations to become familiar with the complexities and possible limitations of the data we provide.

						<title>Overview of the Genome Assembly and Annotation Process</title>
						<p>Figure 1shows how the main steps in the human genome assembly and annotation process are organized and also shows the most significant interdependencies between the steps. The pipeline is not linear, because whenever possible, steps are performed in parallel to reduce the overall time taken to produce an annotated assembly from a new set of data. Some of the steps are run incrementally on a timetable that is independent from that of the main pipeline to produce a new assembly more quickly.

						<sec id="bid.1443">
							<title>Data Freeze</title>
							<p>
								New sequence data that could be used to improve the genome assembly and annotation become available on a daily basis. Since the assembly and annotation process takes several weeks to complete, the data are frozen at the start of the build process by making a copy of all of the data available for use at that time. Freezing the data provides a stable set of inputs for the remainder of the build process. Additional or revised data that become available during the period taken to complete the process are not used until the next build.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1444">
							<title>The Build Cycle</title>
							<p>
								A build begins with a freeze of the input data and ends with the public release of an annotated assembly of genomic sequences (  Figure 1). There are usually a few months between builds so that the latest build can be evaluated and improvements can be made.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1445">
							<title>Steps Run Incrementally</title>
							<p>
								The early steps of the genome assembly and annotation pipeline involve many computationally intensive processes, including masking the repetitive sequences and aligning each genomic sequence to the other genomic sequences, mRNAs, and Expressed Sequence Tags (  ESTs). Running these steps incrementally minimizes the time between starting a new build and being ready to start the assembly and annotation steps. Approximately once a week, independent from the build cycle, new or updated sequences that have been deposited in GenBank are retrieved for processing. Periodically, old versions of the sequences are purged from the set of accumulated data files.
							</p>
							<p>
								The manual refinement of the set of assembled genomic   contigs produced entirely from   finishedsequence is another time-consuming step that is carried out incrementally, approximately once a week.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1446">
							<title>Steps Run Irregularly</title>
							<p>
								Because some data change infrequently, some relatively quick steps are executed on time frames that are not tied to the build cycle. For example, the list of special cases used to override the automatic process is updated whenever the need becomes apparent.

							<title>
								<bold>Genomic Sequences Used for Assembly</bold>
							</title>
							<p>
								Genomic sequences from the following five data sets are processed for use in the assembly:
							</p>
							<p>
								<bold>High-Throughput Genomic Sequences.</bold>
								Human high-throughput genomic sequences ( HTGSs) are retrieved using the Entrezquery system ( Chapter 15). The query used returns sequences for all entries that contain the HTG keyword, regardless of whether the sequence is finishedor is in any of the unfinished draftphases.
							</p>
							<p>
								<bold>Finished Chromosome Sequences.</bold>
								The center that coordinates the sequencing of a finished chromosome submits a specification regarding how to build the sequence of that chromosome from its component clone sequences to a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/genome-map/data/?cvsroot=Ensembl" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">data repository</ext-link>at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The sequences specified for any finished chromosomes are retrieved from GenBank and included in the set of genomic sequences to be processed for an assembly.
							</p>
							<p>
								<bold>Genomic Sequences from the Tiling Paths of Individual Chromosomes.</bold>
								The human genome sequencing centers use a variety of experimental evidence to compile an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/chromReports/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ordered list</ext-link>of clones they believe provides the best coverage for each chromosome. At least once every 2 months, the sequencing centers submit an updated minimal tiling path for each chromosome to a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/genome-map/data/?cvsroot=Ensembl" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">data repository</ext-link>at the EBI. These tiling path files (TPFs) include Accession numbers if sequence for a clone is available. The tiling path repository is checked each day for the Accession numbers from any tiling path that has been updated. Any secondary Accession numbers are replaced with the corresponding primary Accession numbers, and any invalid Accession numbers are flagged to prevent those sequences from being used for assembly. The latest version of the sequence for each Accession number in the most recent clone tiling paths is retrieved from GenBank and included in the set of genomic sequences to be processed for assembly.
							</p>
							<p>
								<bold>Assembled Blocks of Contiguous Finished Genomic Sequence.</bold>
								As the sequences for individual clones are finished, they are merged with overlapping finished sequences to form contigs ( 
								3). The primary source for identifying neighboring clones is the clone tiling path for each chromosome. Additional information is obtained from some GenBank entries that contain annotation specifying the neighboring clones. BLAST( 
								4) is used to align the sequences of candidate pairs of clones, and a merged sequence is produced automatically if the expected overlap is confirmed by the sequence alignment. When the automatic processes do not find an expected overlap, there is a manual review to find the correct overlap, refining the clone order if necessary. The most recent set of finished contigs are processed for assembly.
							</p>
							<p>
								<bold>Additional Genomic Sequences.</bold>
								A few other specific human genomic sequences are added to the assembly set because they contain genes that may not be represented in the genomic sequences from the other sources.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1450">
							<title>
								<bold>Genomic Sequences Used for Ordering and Orienting</bold>
							</title>
							<p>
								Sequences known to come from both ends of the same cloned genomic fragment provide valuable linking information that helps to order and orient sequence contigs in the assembly step ( 
								5, 
								6). The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp.cshl.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SNP Consortium</ext-link>sequenced the ends of the inserts in several million plasmid clones containing small (0.86 Kbp) fragments of human genomic DNA. In many cases, both ends of the same insert were sequenced (Table 4 in Ref. 
								7), thereby providing a set of plasmid paired-end sequences.

							<title>
								<bold>Genomic Sequences Used for Annotation</bold>
							</title>
							<p>
								<bold>Curated Genomic Regions.</bold>
								The Reference Sequence project ( Chapter 18; Refs. 
								8, 
								9) provides reviewed annotated sequences for a number of genomic regions that are difficult to annotate correctly by automated processes (e.g., immunoglobulin gene regions). These Reference Sequences (RefSeqs) are aligned to the assembled genome so that the curated annotation can be transferred to the assembled genomic sequence. RefSeqs for known pseudogenes are also aligned, not only to enable transfer of the correct annotation but, more importantly, to prevent prediction of erroneous model transcripts and proteins.
							</p>
							<p>
								<bold>BAC End Sequences</bold>. Sequences from the ends of human genomic inserts in Bacterial Artificial Chromosome ( BAC) clones are used to help map the location of specific clones onto the assembled genome sequence. The BAC end sequences are obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbGSS</ext-link>(see Chapter 1). The clone names are extracted and converted to a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/clone/nomenclature.shtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">standardized format</ext-link>to facilitate linking of the BAC end sequences with mapping data and additional sequences for the same clone, when these are available.

						<sec id="bid.1452">
							<title>
								<bold>Genomic Sequences Used for Alignment</bold>
							</title>
							<p>
								Human genomic sequences that are not used for either assembly or annotation are processed so that their relationships to the assembled genome can be displayed in Map Viewer ( Chapter 20). Most genomic sequences deposited in GenBank by individual scientists will not be HTG and therefore will not be used for assembly; however, they are used for alignment. The exceptions are a few non-HTG sequences that are used for assembly, because they are included in the clone tiling path of an individual chromosome or in an assembled block of finished sequence. Any sequences intended for assembly but not used, either because they are redundant or are rejected by one of the quality screens in the assembly process, are also used for alignment.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1453">
							<title>Human Transcript Sequences</title>

									<bold>Removing Contaminants</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Draft-quality HTGSs sometimes contain segments of sequence derived from foreign sources, most commonly the cloning vector or bacterial host. Finished sequences are usually, but not always, free of such contaminants. Common contaminants introduce artificial blocks of homologous sequence that can give rise to misleading alignments between two unrelated genomic sequences. MegaBLAST( 10) is used to compare the raw genomic sequences to a database of contaminant sequences (including the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">UniVec</ext-link>database of vector sequences, the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>genome, bacterial insertion sequences, and bacteriophage). Any foreign segments are removed from draft-quality sequence or masked in finished sequence to prevent them from participating in alignments.

							<sec id="bid.1461">
								<title>
									<bold>Masking of Repetitive Sequences</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Sequences that occur in many copies in the genome will align to many different clones. Such repetitive sequences include interspersed repeats (SINEs, LINEs, LTR elements, and DNA transposons), satellite sequences, and low-complexity sequences ( 
									7, 11, 12). Matches between repetitive sequences on unrelated clones make it difficult to identify alignments that indicate a genuine overlap between clones. To eliminate the confounding matches that are based only on repetitive sequences, the genomic sequences are run through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">RepeatMasker</ext-link>to identify known repeats. Repeats are masked by converting the sequence to lowercase letters so that they do not initiate alignments.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1462">
								<title>
									<bold>Fragmentation of Draft Sequences</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Draft HTGSs consist of a set of sequence contigs derived from a particular clone artificially linked together to form a single sequence. The masked, draft genomic sequences are split at the gaps between their constituent contigs to create separate sequence fragments that can be aligned independently. Vector sequences and other contaminants are also removed at this stage by trimming or further splitting the sequence fragments.

							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1463">
								<title>
									<bold>Determination of STS Content</bold>

								<title>
									<bold>Filtering</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Sequences from other clones being sequenced at the same institution can occasionally cross-contaminate draft HTGSs. The contaminating sequences may come from another clone from the same organism or from another organism. The raw genomic sequences are screened in several ways to detect cross-contamination: ( <italic>a</italic>) they are compared with the genome sequences from completely sequenced organisms using MegaBLAST ( 10); ( <italic>b</italic>) they are screened for the presence of organism-specific interspersed repeats using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">RepeatMasker</ext-link>; and ( <italic>3</italic>) they are screened for the presence of mapped STS markers from other organisms using e-PCR ( 13). Any input sequence that contains foreign sequences, repeats, or markers is flagged for removal from the data set used for assembly. Draft sequences longer than the maximum insert length expected for a genomic clone are also rejected because it is likely they are contaminated with sequences from at least one other clone.
								</p>
								<p>
									At this stage, draft sequences composed of fragments that are too small to contribute significantly to the assembly or that are tagged with the HTGS_CANCELLED keyword are also flagged for removal. Another filter rejects sequences annotated as being from another organism or as being RNA, erroneously included in the input sequences.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1465">
								<title>
									<bold>Chromosome Assignment</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									To improve assembly of the genomic sequences, the input genomic sequences are assigned to a specific chromosome before attempting to merge the sequences. Genomic sequences that appear on any of the chromosome tiling paths are automatically assigned to the designated chromosome. Other genomic sequences are assigned to a chromosome based on: ( <italic>a</italic>) annotation on the submitted GenBank record; ( <italic>b</italic>) the presence of multiple STS markers that have been mapped to the same chromosome; ( <italic>c</italic>) fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic>hybridization ( FISH) mapping ( 14, 15); or ( <italic>d</italic>) personal communication from a scientist with specialized knowledge. If there is no assignment, or the assignments are conflicted, the sequences are treated as unassigned and assembled without constraint by chromosome.

						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1466">
							<title>Filtering of Transcript Sequences</title>
							<p>
								Transcript sequences that contain sequences derived from vectors or other common contaminants can produce artificial alignments to the assembled genomic sequence. The input transcript sequences are therefore compared with a database of contaminants using MegaBLAST (  10), as described for genomic sequences. Any transcripts with significant matches to the sequence of a contaminant are excluded from the set of transcript sequences used for genome assembly or annotation.
							</p>
							<p>
								mRNA sequences shorter than 300 bases are excluded from the set of sequences that are aligned to the genomic sequences because they are too small to contribute significantly to genome assembly or annotation. Also excluded are any mRNA sequences flagged because they do not represent the true sequence of a transcript, e.g., those that are chimeric or contain genomic sequences.

						<title>Alignment of Sequences to the Input Genomic Sequences</title>
						<p>
							Alignment of the input genomic sequences to each other and to various other sequences is essential for both genome assembly and genome annotation. All relevant sequences are initially aligned to the unassembled genomic sequences because this means that the computationally intensive alignment processes can be run incrementally at an early stage in the pipeline. If necessary, these alignments are remapped to the sequence of the assembled genome at a later stage by a process that requires relatively little computation.

							<title>Alignment of Genomic Sequences to Each Other</title>
							<p>
								Assembly of the genomic sequences from individual clones into longer contiguous sequences (contigs) requires knowledge of which sequences overlap. The overlaps between genomic sequences are evaluated by aligning the sequences from individual genomic clones to each other. After masking of repeats, decontamination and fragmentation, each fragment of genomic sequence is aligned pairwise to all of the other fragments using MegaBLAST (  10). Alignments that are sufficiently long and of sufficiently high percentage identity are saved for consideration in the assembly step.

						<title>Genome Assembly</title>
						<p>
							The input genomic sequences are assembled into a series of genomic sequence contigs. These are then ordered, oriented with respect to each other, and placed along each chromosome with appropriately sized gaps inserted between adjacent contigs. The resulting genome assembly thus consists of a set of genomic sequence contigs and a specification for how to arrange the sequence contigs along each chromosome.

								A chromosome sequence is considered   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10000923" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">finished</ext-link>when any gaps that remain cannot be closed using current cloning and sequencing technology. In practice, therefore, the sequence for a finished chromosome usually consists of a small number of genomic sequence contigs. These are assembled from their component clone sequences according to the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/genome-map/data/?cvsroot=Ensembl" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">specification</ext-link>provided by the center responsible for sequencing that chromosome. This specification also prescribes the order, orientation, and estimated sizes for the gaps between contigs.

						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1475">
							<title>Unfinished Chromosomes</title>
							<p>
								Genomic sequence contigs for unfinished chromosomes are assembled and laid out based largely on the clone   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/chromReports/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">tiling path</ext-link>. However, the tiling paths do not specify the orientation of the clone sequences or how they should be joined; therefore, data on the alignment of the input genomic sequences to each other and to other sequences are also used to guide the assembly. Genomic sequences that augment the initial set of genomic contigs based on the tiling path clones are also incorporated.

							<sec id="bid.1476">
								<title>
									<bold>Resolution of Conflicts in the Chromosome Tiling Paths</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Before the tiling paths are used in the genome assembly, the order of the finished clone sequences included in the tiling paths is compared with the specifications used to assemble the curated contigs of finished sequence. Discrepancies are resolved before proceeding with the assembly. Sequence from any clone should appear at just one place in the assembled genome; therefore, if a clone is listed more than once in the tiling paths, only the location with the best evidence is used in the assembly step.

								<title>
									<bold>Assembly of the Genomic Sequence Contigs</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Adjacent, finished clone sequences from the chromosome tiling path that have good sequence overlap are merged. Tiling path draft sequences that are adjacent to and overlap the finished clone sequences or other draft clone sequences are added to extend the initial genomic sequence contigs. After that, genomic sequences from clones not on any chromosome tiling path are added, provided they have good overlaps with the assembled tiling path clones. Genomic sequences from additional clones may be added if they provide the sequence for a known gene that is missing from the existing genomic sequence contigs. Finally, the individual fragments of draft sequences are ordered and oriented.
								</p>
								<p>
									<bold>Assembly of Finished Sequences from Tiling Path Clones.</bold>
									The quality of any overlaps between finished clone sequences that are adjacent in the clone tiling path are assessed using the alignments between pairs of genomic sequences that were produced in advance. Sequences that have high-quality overlaps, or that are known from annotation or other data to abut, are merged to form a genomic sequence contig. Clone sequences that have no good overlaps are retained as separate contigs.
								</p>
								<p>
									<bold>Addition of Draft Sequences from Tiling Path Clones.</bold>
									The procedure used for merging draft sequence from tiling path clones is similar to that described for merging finished sequences, except that the minimum-overlap quality required for merging is different. An overlap involving a draft sequence can contain more mismatches, but must be longer, than an overlap between two finished sequences. Preference is given to finished sequences so that a contig made by merging finished and draft sequences will contain the finished sequence for the overlapping portion. Draft clone sequences that have no good overlaps are retained as separate contigs.
								</p>
								<p>
									<bold>Addition of Sequences from Other Genomic Clones.</bold>
									Genomic sequences from clones that are not on any chromosome tiling path are used to close, or extend into, gaps in the backbone of genomic contigs assembled based on the tiling paths. Genomic sequences that are fully contained within the existing genomic contigs are not used. Any remaining genomic sequences that were either assigned to the relevant chromosome or could not be assigned to any chromosome are evaluated, and sequences that have good-quality overlaps with genomic contigs are merged in to extend a contig or to join two adjacent contigs, if two additional conditions are met: (1) the gap must be sufficiently large to accommodate the additional sequence; and (2) the Sequence Tagged Site (STS) marker content of the additional clone sequence must be compatible with that of the flanking clone sequences when compared with various STS maps.
								</p>
								<p>
									After all of the chromosomes have been assembled, any remaining genomic clone sequence that contains a known gene not present in the other contigs is added to the assembly as a separate contig.
								</p>
								<p>
									<bold>Ordering and Orienting Draft Sequence Fragments.</bold>
									The order and orientation of the fragments of HTGS_PHASE1 draft sequence need to be defined before sequence made from contigs that include this category of draft sequence can be completed. Some fragments may be ordered and oriented by overlaps with sequences from adjacent clones. Many more can be defined by aligning them with mRNAs, ESTs, or plasmid paired-end sequences. Any fragments whose order and orientation remain undefined are placed in the nearest open gap and given an arbitrary orientation. Fragments of draft sequence are connected to flanking sequences and to each other by runs of 100 unknown bases (Ns), which represent an arbitrarily sized gap in the sequence.

							<sec id="bid.1483">
								<title>
									<bold>Placement of the Genomic Contigs</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									After the genomic sequence contigs are assembled, they are oriented and placed in order along each chromosome with appropriately sized gaps inserted between adjacent contigs. The chromosome <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/chromReports/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">tiling paths</ext-link>specify the order of the clone sequences and the sizes for some gaps. Therefore, the order and orientation of most of the genomic sequence contigs are derived from the tiling paths. Many of the remaining contigs are placed by comparison of the STS marker content of the contigs, as determined by e-PCR ( 13) using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unists" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">UniSTS</ext-link>database, to various STS maps. There are some contigs that can be assigned to a specific chromosome but cannot be placed along that chromosome. Others cannot even be assigned to a specific chromosome and therefore remain unplaced within the genome assembly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Gaps between the clone contigs laid out in the chromosome tiling paths are arbitrarily set at 50 Kbp, and 3 Mbp for the centromere, unless another gap size is specified in the tiling path. Any remaining gaps between genomic sequence contigs are arbitrarily set to 10 Kbp.

							<title>Quality Control</title>
							<p>
								The provisional assembly is checked for consistency with the chromosome tiling paths and various STS maps. The order in which the component clone sequences appear in the assembled chromosomes is compared with their order in the tiling paths on which the assembly was based. The STS marker order along each chromosome in the provisional assembly, as determined by e-PCR (  13) using the UniSTS database, is checked for consistency with a set of STS maps. Haussler et al. at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) also perform a set of independent quality checks on the provisional assembly. In addition to comparing the assembly to the chromosome tiling paths and to various STS maps, they also look for potentially misassembled contigs using alignments of BAC end sequences. Any serious errors in the assembly may be corrected by repeating the assembly steps using different parameters or by manually editing the assembly.

						<title>Annotation of Genes</title>
						<p>
							Identification of genes within the genome assembly reveals the functional significance of particular stretches of genomic sequence. Genes are found using three complementary approaches: (<italic>a</italic>) known genes are placed primarily by aligning mRNAs to the assembled genomic contigs; (<italic>b</italic>) additional genes are located based on alignment of ESTs to the assembled genomic contigs; and (<italic>c</italic>) previously unknown genes are predicted using hints provided by protein homologies. Whenever possible, predicted genes are identified by homology between the protein they encode and known protein sequences.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1487">
							<title>Generation of Transcript-based Gene Models</title>
							<p>
								Alignments between known transcripts and the assembled genomic sequences are processed to produce gene models. Each gene model consists of an ordered series of exons. The transcripts defining each gene model are used as evidence to support that model.
							</p>
							<sec id="bid.1488">
								<title>
									<bold>Alignment of Transcripts to the Assembled Genome</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									The alignments between RefSeq RNA sequences, mRNA and EST sequences from GenBank and the component genomic sequences are remapped to produce alignments of these transcripts to the assembled genomic contigs.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1489">
								<title>
									<bold>Production of Candidate Gene Models</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									A candidate gene model is produced from each set of alignments between a particular transcript and one strand of a particular genomic contig as follows: (1) putative exons are identified by looking for mRNA splice sites near the ends of those alignments that satisfy minimum length and percentage identity criteria; (2) a mutually compatible set of exons for the model is selected by applying rules, such as restrictions on the size of an intron, that define plausible exonintron structures; and (3) BLAST ( 
									4) may be used to produce additional alignments to try to identify exons that were missed because they were too short to be represented in the initial set of transcript alignments. Candidate gene models are only retained if good-quality alignments between their exons and the defining transcript cover either more than half the length of the transcript or more than 1 Kbp.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1490">
								<title>
									<bold>Selection of the Best RefSeq RNA-based Gene Models</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Each RefSeq RNA represents a distinct transcript produced from a particular gene ( Chapter 18; Refs. 
									8, 
									9). Hence, there should not be more than one gene model corresponding to any given RefSeq RNA. Therefore, all gene models based on a particular RefSeq RNA are compared, and the best one is selected. Because the RefSeq RNA is taken to be the best representation of a particular transcript, this gene model is preserved without any further modification. Any extra models may represent paralogs; therefore, they are included with the mRNA- and EST-based models for further processing. Between builds, RefSeq RNAs are refined based on a review of related gene models and transcript alignments produced during the genome annotation process.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1491">
								<title>
									<bold>Exon Refinement</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Many gene models may be produced for the same gene because the input data set frequently contains multiple EST or mRNA sequences representing the same transcript. This redundancy is used to refine the splice sites defining a particular exon. Similar exons are clustered, and splice sites may be adjusted in some models to match those used by the majority of models containing the same exon. Inconsistent models may be discarded at this stage, unless they have sufficient support to be retained as likely splice variants.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1492">
								<title>
									<bold>Chaining of Transcript-based Gene Models</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Many of the mRNAs and most of the ESTs used to generate the initial gene models provide sequence for only part of the native transcript. Overlapping gene models that are compatible with each other are combined into an extended model. This chaining step produces models more likely to represent the full gene.

							</title>
							<p>
								<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genes.mit.edu/genomescan/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GenomeScan</ext-link>, an   <italic>ab initio</italic>gene prediction program, is used to provide models for genes inferred from the genomic sequence using hints provided by protein homologies (  17). The genes predicted by GenomeScan are combined with the transcript-based gene models, but they are also retained as a distinct set of models that can be viewed or searched separately.
							</p>
							<sec id="bid.1494">
								<title>
									<bold>Dividing the Genomic Sequences into Segments</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									GenomeScan produces better results when long genomic sequences are broken into shorter segments at putative gene boundaries. The locations of gene models based on RefSeq RNA alignments are, therefore, used to divide the assembled genomic contigs into segments. Repetitive sequences are masked by remapping the repeats found in the component genomic sequences.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1495">
								<title>
									<bold>Producing Protein Hints for GenomeScan</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									GenomeScan can use data on protein homologies to improve its gene predictions ( 17). The locations of genomic sequences that potentially code for polypeptides with homology to other proteins are obtained from three sources. Significant alignments between translated genomic segments and vertebrate proteins are obtained by filtering and remapping the precomputed alignments. Significant alignments between translated genomic sequences and conserved protein domains are obtained in the same manner. A third set of alignments comes from running GenomeScan without any hints. The proteins predicted by this initial run are aligned to proteins from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SWISS-PROT</ext-link>( 18) and NCBI RefSeq proteins ( 
									8, 
									9) using blastp ( 
									4). The eukaryotic protein with the best match is then aligned to the genomic sequence segments using tblastn ( 
									4). These three sets of data are converted into the format required by GenomeScan and merged to produce a single set of protein hints.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1496">
								<title>
									<bold>Predicting Genes Using GenomeScan</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Each segment of genomic sequence is processed by GenomeScan using the combined set of protein homology-based hints as an additional input. This produces one model containing all of the predicted exons for each putative gene. Models with coding sequences shorter than 90 amino acids are discarded. Each remaining model is aligned to proteins from SWISS-PROT and NCBI RefSeq proteins using blastp. The eukaryotic protein with the best match to any model is used as evidence for that model and to provide a clue as to the possible function of that model.
								</p>
							</sec>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1497">
							<title>Consolidation of Gene Models</title>
							<p>
								Consolidation of the transcript-based gene models and the predicted gene models forms a single set of models. Models are clustered into genes if they share one or more exons or if LocusLink (  Chapter 19; Refs.   
								8,   
								9) indicates that the transcripts used as evidence for the models come from the same gene. If a model is entirely contained within a longer model, it is redundant and, therefore, eliminated. Sets of identical models are reduced to a single representative model linked to all of the supporting evidence. For sets of very similar models, a single model is picked as a representative, giving preference to models based on RefSeq RNAs or on GenBank mRNAs. Predicted gene models that significantly overlap transcript-based models but that are not sufficiently similar to consolidate are discarded.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1498">
							<title>Pruning of Gene Models</title>
							<p>
								Some gene models are discarded because: superior gene annotation is available from a curated genomic region, they are likely to represent pseudogenes, or they are incompatible with other gene models.
							</p>
							<sec id="bid.1499">
								<title>
									<bold>Gene Models Superceded by Curated Genomic Regions</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									The manually reviewed annotations from curated genomic region RefSeqs are used in preference to any corresponding gene models generated by automated processing. The curated genomic regions are aligned to the assembled genomic contigs by remapping the alignments between these RefSeqs and the component genomic sequences. Any gene model that significantly overlaps a segment of the assembled sequence that corresponds to a curated genomic region is discarded.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1500">
								<title>
									<bold>Gene Models Likely to Be Pseudogenes</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									When transcripts from a particular gene are aligned to the genomic sequences, they will align not only to the active copy of the gene but also to any segment of the genome containing a pseudogene derived from the active gene. Because model transcripts or model proteins that represent nontranscribed pseudogenes are undesirable, an attempt is made to identify and remove such models.
								</p>
								<p>
									Whenever possible, alignments of RefSeqs for pseudogenes, either curated genomic regions or RNAs, are used to annotate pseudogenes. Some additional models derived from pseudogenes that are not yet represented by RefSeqs are eliminated by the following mechanism. All models based on the same supporting mRNA are compared with respect to the percent identity of the alignments and the number of exons. Only the model with the strongest evidence is retained.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1501">
								<title>
									<bold>Conflicting Gene Models</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									When two gene models are found to have an extensive overlap, then in general only the model with the stronger evidence is retained. However, models based on RefSeqs are always retained. Whereas any model not based on a RefSeq is discarded if it overlaps a model that is RefSeq based, two RefSeq-based models that overlap are both retained.
								</p>
							</sec>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1502">
							<title>Location of Model Coding Regions</title>
							<p>
								Initially, the longest open reading frame from each gene model is annotated as the protein coding sequence. This annotation can be revised if evidence associated with that model provides support for an alternative coding region. The protein coding sequence from any transcript used as evidence for a gene model is compared with the longest open reading frame in that model using BLAST (  
								4). If the two do not match, the conflict is noted, and the annotation is revised if there is evidence to support an alternative coding region. For example, the coding sequence from the transcript evidence may indicate that an alternate translation start site is used, or that the model contains a premature termination codon. Models with coding regions less than 90 amino acids long are discarded, unless they are based on a RefSeq.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1503">
							<title>Relating Gene Models to Known Genes, Transcripts, and Proteins</title>
							<p>
								The set of gene models produced by the preceding steps is a mixture of models for predicted genes and for known genes. To help identify models representing known genes, the model transcripts are compared with known transcripts. To help name the predicted genes, the proteins encoded by the models are also compared with known proteins.
							</p>
							<sec id="bid.1504">
								<title>
									<bold>Relating the Model Transcripts to Known Transcripts</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									To provide continuity from build to build and to identify genes based on their predicted transcripts, MegaBLAST ( 10) is used to compare model RNAs to: ( <italic>a</italic>) RefSeq RNAs; ( <italic>b</italic>) mRNAs from GenBank; and ( <italic>c</italic>) model RNAs from the previous build. These comparisons are reported as reciprocal best hits if: ( <italic>a</italic>) they produce a significant hit; ( <italic>b</italic>) no other model has a better hit to that particular RNA; and ( <italic>c</italic>) no other RNA has a better hit to that particular model.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.1505">
								<title>
									<bold>Relating the Model Proteins to Known Proteins</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									The eukaryotic proteins with the best match to each protein predicted by the annotation process are used to identify the best model for a possible gene and to assign a name to gene models that are novel. The proteins encoded by the models are aligned to proteins from SWISS-PROT ( 18), NCBI RefSeq proteins ( 
									8, 
									9), and the NCBI non-redundant protein <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/html/blastcgihelp.html#protein_databases" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">database</ext-link>using blastp ( 
									4). The name of the eukaryotic protein with the best match, its sequence identifier, and match score are recorded for each predicted protein with a significant hit.
								</p>
							</sec>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1506">
							<title>Assigning Gene Identifiers to Models</title>
							<p>
								Gene models are attributed to known genes whenever the correspondence is clear. If a model RNA has a reciprocal best hit with a known RNA, then the annotation of the known RNA is used to identify the gene. The first models to be assigned to genes are those that have reciprocal best hits with RefSeq RNAs. This is followed by assignment of those models that have reciprocal best hits to models from the previous build or to GenBank mRNAs. Gene data for models that match a mRNA not yet represented by a RefSeq are obtained from NCBI gene-specific databases (currently LocusLink,   Chapter 19). If the mRNA is associated with an entry in one of these databases, then the information attached to that gene record (e.g., symbols, names, and database cross-references) is used in the annotation. If the correspondence with known genes is ambiguous, as may occur if there are undocumented paralogs, then an interim gene identifier is assigned.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1511">
							<title>Selection of Transcript Models to Represent Each Gene</title>
							<p>
								Multiple models based on alternative transcripts for some genes may be produced. In most of these cases, one transcript model is selected to represent the product of the gene for annotation purposes. Any homology between eukaryotic proteins and proteins encoded by the models guides the choice between alternative models. Multiple transcripts are annotated only if the models are based on RefSeq mRNAs representing alternative transcripts from the same gene.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although alternative transcript models are not annotated, the alignments between the transcripts that represent alternative splicing and genomic contigs are processed for display in Map Viewer, Evidence Viewer, and Model Maker (see   Chapter 20).
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1512">
							<title>Naming of Gene Products</title>
							<p>
								The transcripts and protein products of any models that have been assigned to a known gene are given the product names that appear in the LocusLink entry for that gene. The gene products from other genes are named based on any significant homology to other eukaryotic proteins, provided that the matching protein has a meaningful name (i.e., names such as Hypothetical... are ignored).
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1513">
							<title>Annotation of the Assembled Genomic Contigs</title>
							<p>
								The genomic contig RefSeqs are annotated with features that provide information about the location of genes, mRNAs, and coding regions. Features from curated genomic region RefSeqs are copied to the contigs based on the alignment between the curated sequence and the corresponding contig. Protein domains from the Conserved Domain Database (CDD; Ref.   16) are identified using reverse position-specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST; Ref.   
								4), and their locations are annotated. A description of the evidence supporting those RNAs and proteins that are not curated RefSeqs, i.e., those that are models, is also recorded.

						<title>Annotation of Other Features</title>
						<p>
							Reference sequences produced by the genome assembly process are annotated with features that provide landmarks valuable for making connections between maps based on different coordinate systems and for associating genes with diseases.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1515">
							<title>Annotation of STSs</title>
							<p>
								Placement of STSs on the genome assembly allows sequence-based data to be integrated with non-sequence-based maps that contain STS markers, such as genetic and radiation hybrid maps. STSs are identified by using e-PCR (  13) to find sequences that match the STS primer pairs from UniSTS, the spacing of which is consistent with the reported PCR product size. The number of times that each STS appears in the assembled genome is recorded so that only those STSs that appear at only one or two locations in the assembled genome are annotated.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1516">
							<title>Annotation of Clones</title>
							<p>
								Placement on the genome assembly of clones that have been mapped to cytogenetic bands by FISH provides the means to determine the correspondence between the sequence and cytogenetic coordinate systems (  14,   15). Knowing this correspondence allows the integration of sequence-based data with cytogenetic data. For human, only those clones mapped by fluorescence   <italic>in situ</italic>hybridization (FISH) by the human BAC Resource Consortium (see the   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/hbrc.shtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Human BAC Resource</ext-link>) are annotated. Clones are placed using three types of sequence tags. Clones that have sequence for the genomic insert, either draft or finished, with a GenBank Accession number are localized by remapping the alignment between the clone sequence and other genomic clones to the assembled genomic contigs. Similarly, clones that have BAC end sequences are localized by remapping the alignment between the BAC end sequences and genomic clone sequences to the assembled genomic contigs. Clones that have STS markers confirmed by PCR or hybridization experiments are mapped using the locations in the assembled contigs of STS markers that were identified by e-PCR. The number of places that each clone appears in the assembled genome is recorded so that only those clones that either have a unique placement in the assembled genome or are placed twice on the same chromosome are annotated.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1517">
							<title>Annotation of Sequence Variation</title>
							<p>
								Placement of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and other variations on the genome provides numerous landmarks that are valuable for associating genes with diseases (  Chapter 5). Variations from   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dbSNP</ext-link>(  19) are placed in their genomic contexts using the sequences that flank the variation. Flanking sequences are first run through   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">RepeatMasker</ext-link>to mask repetitive sequences and then aligned to the assembled genomic sequence contigs using MegaBLAST (  10). The resulting matches are classified as either high or low confidence, depending on the quality of the alignment, and the number of matches for each SNP is recorded so that only those SNPs that map to one or two locations in the assembled genome are annotated.

								A fully annotated Refseq entry is made for each genomic sequence contig. Separate RefSeq model RNA and protein entries are also made for any of the transcripts and coding regions annotated on genomic contigs not identified as existing RefSeqs. Finally, a RefSeq entry is made for each chromosome by combining the annotated sequences of the genomic contigs in the appropriate order and with the appropriate spacing.

								<title>
									<bold>Maps Based on Sequence Coordinates</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Maps that display those features annotated on the genomic sequence contigs (genes, STSs, clones, and SNPs) are generated by translating the positions of the features on the contigs into chromosome coordinates. Contig coordinates are translated into chromosome coordinates using the positions of the contigs along each chromosome, as determined in the genome assembly step. Using this same method, alignments between various sequences and the genomic contigs are translated into chromosome coordinates to produce additional maps that show the locations of the aligned sequences on the chromosomes. Maps generated from sequence alignments include maps that show the genomic positions of mRNA plus EST sequences, or genomic sequences from GenBank. The specifications used to build each genomic contig are also translated into chromosome coordinates to produce one map that shows the component sequences used to assemble each contig and another that simply shows the finished and draft sections of the contigs.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							Entrez is the text-based search and retrieval system used at NCBI for all of the major databases, including PubMed, Nucleotide and Protein Sequences, Protein Structures, Complete Genomes, Taxonomy, OMIM, and many others. Entrez is at once an indexing and retrieval system, a collection of data from many sources, and an organizing principle for biomedical information. These general concepts are the focus of this chapter. Other chapters cover the details of a specific Entrez database (e.g., PubMed in Chapter 2) or a specific source of data (e.g., GenBank in Chapter 1).

						<title>Entrez Design Principles</title>
						<sec id="bid.590">
							<title>History</title>
							<p>
								The first version of Entrez was distributed by NCBI in 1991 on CD-ROM. At that time, it consisted of nucleotide sequences from GenBank and PDB; protein sequences from translated GenBank, PIR, SWISS-PROT, PDB, and PRF; and associated citations and abstracts from MEDLINE (now PubMed and referred to as PubMed below). We will use this first design to illustrate the principles behind Entrez.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.591">
							<title>Entrez Nodes Represent Data</title>
							<p>
								An Entrez node is a collection of data that is grouped together and indexed together. It is usually referred to as an Entrez database. In the first version of Entrez, there were three nodes: published articles, nucleotide sequences, and protein sequences. Each node represents specific data objects of the same type, e.g., protein sequences, which are each given a unique ID (UID) within that logical Entrez Proteins node. Records in a node may come from a single source (e.g., all published articles are from PubMed) or many sources (e.g., proteins are from translated GenBank sequences,   SWISS-PROT, or   PIR) (  Figure 1).  
								<fig id="bid.592">
									<label>
										1
									</label>
									<caption>
										<title>The original version of Entrez had just 3 nodes: nucleotides, proteins, and PubMed abstracts. Entrez has now grown to nearly 20 nodes.</title>
									</caption>
									<graphic mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="ch15f1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
								</fig>
							</p>
							<p>
								Note that the UID identifies a single, well-defined object (i.e., a particular protein sequence or PubMed citation). There may be other information about objects in nodes, such as protein names or   EC numbers, that may be used as index terms to find the record, but these pieces of information are not the central organizing principle of the node. Each data object represents a stable, objective observation of data as much as possible, rather than interpretations of the data, which are subject to change or confusion over time or across disciplines. For example, barring experimental error, a particular mRNA sequence report is not likely to change over the years; however, the given name, position on the chromosome, or function of the protein product may well change as our knowledge develops. Even a published article is a stable observation. The fact that the article was published at a certain time and contained certain words will not change over time, although the importance of the article topic may change many times.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.593">
							<title>Entrez Nodes Are Intended for Linking</title>
							<p>
								Another criterion for selecting a particular data type to be an Entrez node is to enable linking to other Entrez nodes in a useful and reliable way. For example, given a protein sequence, it is very useful to quickly find the nucleotide sequence that encodes it. Or given a research article, it is useful to find the sequences it describes, if any.
							</p>
							<sec id="bid.594">
								<title>
									<bold>Links between Nodes</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									One way to achieve this is to put all of the information into one record. For example, many GenBank records contain pertinent article citations. However, PubMed also contains the article abstract and additional index terms (e.g., MeSH terms); furthermore, the bibliographic information is also more carefully curated than the citation in a GenBank entry. It therefore makes much more sense to search for articles in PubMed rather than in GenBank.
								</p>
								<p>
									When a subset of articles has been retrieved from PubMed, it may be useful to link to sequence information associated with the abstracts. The article citation in the GenBank record can be used to establish the link to PubMed and, conversely, to make the reciprocal link from the PubMed article back to the GenBank record. Treating each Entrez node separately but enabling linking between related data in different nodes means that the retrieval characteristics for each node can be optimized for the characteristics and strengths of that node, whereas related data can be reached in nodes with different strengths.
								</p>
								<p>
									This approach also means that new connections between data can be made. In the example above, the GenBank record cited the published article, but there was no link from that article in PubMed to the sequence until Entrez made the reciprocal link from PubMed. Now, when searching articles in PubMed, it is possible to find this sequence, although no PubMed records have been changed. Because of this design principle, the Entrez system is richly interconnected, although any particular association may originate from only one record in one node.
								</p>
							</sec>
							<sec id="bid.595">
								<title>
									<bold>Links within Nodes</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									Another type of linking in Entrez is between records of the same type, often called neighbors, in sequence and structure nodes. Most often these associations are computed at NCBI. For example, in Entrez Proteins, all of the protein sequences are BLASTed against each other, and the highest-scoring hits are stored as indexes within the node. This means that each protein record has associated with it a list of highly similar sequences, or neighbors.
								</p>
								<p>
									Again, associations that may not be present in the original records can be made. For example, a well-annotated SWISS-PROT record for a particular protein may have fields that describe other protein or GenBank records from which it was derived. At a later date, a closely related protein may appear in GenBank that will not be referenced by the SWISS-PROT record. However, if a scientist finds an article in PubMed that has a link to the new GenBank record, that person can look at the protein and then use the BLAST-computed neighbors to find the SWISS-PROT record (as well as many others), although neither the SWISS-PROT record nor the new GenBank record refers to each other anywhere.
								</p>
							</sec>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.596">
							<title>Entrez Nodes Are Intended for Computation</title>
							<p>
								There are many advantages to establishing new associations by computational methods (as in the GenBankSWISS-PROT example above), especially for large, rapidly changing data sets such as those in biomedicine.
							</p>
							<p>
								As computers get faster and cheaper, this type of association can be made more efficiently. As data sets get bigger, the problem remains tractable or may even improve because of better statistics. If a new algorithm or approach is found to be an improvement, it is possible to apply it over the whole data set within a practical timescale and by using a reasonable number of resources. Any associations that require human curation, such as the application of controlled vocabularies, do not scale well with rapidly growing sets of data or evolving data interpretations. Although these manual kinds of approaches certainly add value, computational approaches can often produce good results more objectively and efficiently.

						<title>Entrez Is a Discovery System</title>
						<p>
							A data-retrieval system succeeds when you can retrieve the same data you put in. A discovery system is intended to let you find more information than appears in the original data. By making links between selected nodes and making computed associations within the same node, Entrez is designed to infer relationships between different data that may suggest future experiments or assist in interpretation of the available information, although it may come from different sources.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ability to compare genotype information across a huge range of organisms is a powerful tool for molecular biologists. For example, this technique was used in the discovery of a gene associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). The tumor cells from most familial cases of HNPCC had altered, short, repeated DNA sequences, suggesting that DNA replication errors had occurred during tumor development. This information caused a group of investigators to look for human homologs of the well-characterized <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>DNA mismatch repair enzyme, MutS (
							1). Mutants in a <italic>MutS</italic>homolog in yeast, <italic>MSH2</italic>, showed expansion and contraction of dinucleotide repeats similar to the mutation found in the human tumor cells. By comparing the protein sequences between the yeast MSH2, the <italic>E. coli</italic>MutS, and a human gene product isolated and cloned from HNPCC colorectal tumor, the researchers could show that the amino acid sequences of all three proteins were very similar. From this, they inferred that the human gene, which they called <italic>hMSH2</italic>, may also play a role in repairing DNA, and that the mutation found in tumors negatively affects this function, leading to tumor development.
						</p>
						<p>
							The researchers could connect the functional data about the yeast and bacterial genes with the genetic mapping and clinical phenotype information in humans. Entrez is designed to support this kind of process when the underlying data are available electronically. In PubMed, the research paper about the discovery of <italic>hMSH2</italic>(
							1) has links to the protein sequence, which in turn has links to neighbors (related sequences). There are lots of records for this protein and its relatives in many organisms, but among them are the proteins from yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic>that prompted the study. From those records there are links back to the PubMed abstracts of articles that reported these proteins. PubMed also has a neighbor function,  Related articles , that represents other articles that contain words and phrases in common with the current record. Because phrases such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, mismatch repair, and MutS all occur in the current article, many of the articles most related to this one describe studies on the <italic>E. coli</italic>mismatch repair system. These articles may not be directly linked to any sequence themselves and may not contain the words human or colon cancer but are relevant to HNPCC nonetheless, because of what the bacterial system may tell us.

							More nodes are planned for addition in the near future. Each one of these nodes is richly connected to others. Each offers unique information and unique new relationships among its members. The combination of new links and new relationships increases the chances for discovery. The addition of each new node creates different paths through the data that may lead to new connections, without more work on the old nodes.

						<title>How Entrez Works</title>
						<p>
							Entrez integrates data from a large number of sources, formats, and databases into a uniform information model and retrieval system. The actual databases from which records are retrieved and on which the Entrez indexes are based have different designs, based on the type of data, and reside on different machines. These will be referred to as the source databases. A common theme in the implementation of Entrez is that some functions are unique to each source database, whereas others are common to all Entrez databases.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.606">
							<title>A Division of Labor: Basic Principles</title>
							<p>
								Some of the common routines and formats for every Entrez node include the term lists and posting files (i.e., the retrieval engine) used for Boolean queries, the links within and between nodes, and the summary format used for listing search results in which each record is called a DocSum. Generally, an Entrez query is a   Booleanexpression that is evaluated by the common Entrez engine and yields a list of unique ID numbers (UIDs), which identify records in an Entrez node. Given one or more UIDs, Entrez can retrieve the DocSum(s) very quickly. The links made within or between Entrez nodes from one or more UIDs is also a function across all Entrez source databases.
							</p>
							<p>
								The software that tracks the addition of new or updated records or identifies those that should be deleted from Entrez may be unique for each source database. Each database must also have accompanying software to gather index terms, DocSums, and links from the source data and present them to the common Entrez indexer. This can be achieved through either a set of C++ libraries or by generating an XML document in a specific DTD that contains the terms, DocSums, and links. Although the common engine retrieves a DocSum(s) given a UID(s), the retrieval of a full, formatted record is directed to the source database, where software unique to that database is used to format the record correctly. All of this software is written by the NCBI group that runs the database.
							</p>
							<p>
								This combination of database-specific software and a common set of Entrez routines and applications allows code sharing and common large-retrieval server administration but enables flexibility and simplicity for a wide variety of data sources.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.607">
							<title>Software</title>
							<p>
								Although the basic principles of Entrez have remained the same for almost a decade, the software implementation has been through at least three major redesigns and many minor ones.
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently, Entrez is written using the NCBI C++ Toolkit. The indexing fields (which for PubMed, for example, would be Title, Author, Publication Date, Journal, Abstract, and so on) and DocSum fields (which for PubMed are Author, Title, Journal, Publication Date, Volume, and Page Number) for each node are defined in a configuration file; but for performance at runtime, the configuration files are used to automatically generate base classes for each database. These are the basic pieces of information used by Entrez that can also be inherited and used by more database-specific, hand-coded features. The term indexes are based on the Indexed Sequential-Access Method (ISAM) and are in large, shared, memory-mapped files. The postings are large bitmaps, with one bit per document in the node. Depending on how sparsely populated the posting is, the bit array is adaptively compressed on disk using one of four possible schemes. Boolean operations are performed by using AND or OR postings of bit arrays into a result bit array. DocSums are small, fielded data structures stored on the same machines as the postings to support rapid retrieval.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Web-based Entrez retrieval program, called   <italic>query</italic>, is a fast cgi application that uses the Web application framework from the NCBI C++ Toolkit. One aspect of this framework is a set of classes that represents an HTML page. These classes allow the combination of static template pages, on the fly, with callbacks to class methods at tagged parts of the template. The Web page generated in an Entrez session contains elements from static templates and elements generated dynamically from common Entrez classes and from classes unique to one or a few Entrez nodes. Again, this design supports a common core of robust, common functionality maintained by one group, with support for customizations by diverse groups within NCBI.
							</p>
							<p>
								Boolean query processing, DocSum retrieval, and other common functions are supported on a number of load-balanced front-end UNIX machines. Because Entrez can support session context (for example, in the use of query history, NCBI Cubby, Filters, etc.), a history server has been implemented on the front-end machines so that if a user is sent to machine A by the load balancer for their first query but to machine B for the second query, Entrez can quickly locate the user's query history and obtain it from machine A. Other than that, the front-end machines are completely independent of each other and can be added and removed readily from   <italic>query</italic>support. Retrieval of full documents comes from a variety of back-end databases, depending on the node. These might be Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server relational databases of a variety of schemas or text files of various formats. Links are supported using the Sybase IQ database product.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							The comparison of nucleotide or protein sequences from the same or different organisms is a very powerful tool in molecular biology. By finding similarities between sequences, scientists can infer the function of newly sequenced genes, predict new members of gene families, and explore evolutionary relationships. Now that whole genomes are being sequenced, sequence similarity searching can be used to predict the location and function of protein-coding and transcription-regulation regions in genomic DNA.
						</p>
						<p>
							Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (
							1, 
							2) is the tool most frequently used for calculating sequence similarity. BLAST comes in variations for use with different query sequences against different databases. All BLAST applications, as well as information on which BLAST program to use and other help documentation, are listed on the BLAST <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">homepage</ext-link>. This chapter will focus more on how BLAST works, its output, and how both the output and program itself can be further manipulated or customized, rather than on how to use <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Education/BLASTinfo/information3.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BLAST</ext-link>or interpret BLAST results.

						<title>Introduction</title>
						<p>
							The way most people use BLAST is to input a nucleotide or protein sequence as a query against all (or a subset of) the public sequence databases, pasting the sequence into the textbox on one of the BLAST <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Web pages</ext-link>. This sends the query over the Internet, the search is performed on the NCBI databases and servers, and the results are posted back to the person's browser in the chosen display format. However, many biotech companies, genome scientists, and bioinformatics personnel may want to use stand-alone BLAST to query their own, local databases or want to customize BLAST in some way to make it better suit their needs. Stand-alone BLAST comes in two forms: the executables that can be run from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_overview.html#executables" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">command line</ext-link>; or the Standalone WWW <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_overview.html#wwwserver" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BLAST Server</ext-link>, which allows users to set up their own in-house versions of the BLAST Web pages.
						</p>

The best known of these outputs is the default display from BLAST Web pages, the so-called traditional report. As well as obtaining BLAST results in the traditional report, results can also be delivered in structured output, such as a hit table (see below), XML, or ASN.1. The optimal choice of output format depends upon the application. The final part of the chapter discusses stand-alone BLAST and describes possibilities for customization. There are many interfaces to BLAST that are often not exploited by users but can lead to more efficient and robust applications.

						<title>How BLAST Works: The Basics</title>
						<p>
							The BLAST algorithm is a heuristic program, which means that it relies on some smart shortcuts to perform the search faster. BLAST performs local alignments. Most proteins are modular in nature, with functional domains often being repeated within the same protein as well as across different proteins from different species. The BLAST algorithm is tuned to find these domains or shorter stretches of sequence similarity. The local alignment approach also means that a mRNA can be aligned with a piece of genomic DNA, as is frequently required in genome assembly and analysis. If instead BLAST started out by attempting to align two sequences over their entire lengths (known as a global alignment), fewer similarities would be detected, especially with respect to domains and motifs.
						</p>
						<p>
							When a query is submitted via one of the BLAST Web pages, the sequence, plus any other input information such as the database to be searched, word size, expect value, and so on, are fed to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Education/BLASTinfo/BLAST_algorithm.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">algorithm</ext-link>on the BLAST server. BLAST works by first making a look-up table of all the words (short subsequences, which for proteins the default is three letters) and neighboring words, i.e., similar words in the query sequence. The sequence database is then scanned for these hot spots. When a match is identified, it is used to initiate gap-free and gapped extensions of the word.
						</p>
						<p>
							BLAST does not search GenBank flatfiles (or any subset of GenBank flatfiles) directly. Rather, sequences are made into BLAST databases. Each entry is split, and two files are formed, one containing just the header information and one containing just the sequence information. These are the data that the algorithm uses. If BLAST is to be run in stand-alone mode, the data file could consist of local, private data, downloaded NCBI BLAST databases, or a combination of the two.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the algorithm has looked up all possible words from the query sequence and extended them maximally, it assembles the best alignment for each querysequence pair and writes this information to an SeqAlign data structure (in ASN.1; also used by Sequin, see Chapter 12). The SeqAlign structure in itself does not contain the sequence information; rather, it refers to the sequences in the BLAST database (Figure 1).

									<title>How the BLAST results Web pages are assembled.</title>
									<p>
										The QBLAST system located on the BLAST server executes the search, writing information about the sequence alignment in ASN.1. The results can then be formatted by fetching the ASN.1 ( <italic>fetch ASN.1</italic>) and fetching the sequences ( <italic>fetch sequence</italic>) from the BLAST databases. Because the execution of the search algorithm is decoupled from the formatting, the results can be delivered in a variety of formats without re-running the search.

							</fig>
						</p>
						<p>
							The BLAST Formatter, which sits on the BLAST server, can use the information in the SeqAlign to retrieve the similar sequences found and display them in a variety of ways. Thus, once a query has been completed, the results can be reformatted without having to re-execute the search. This is possible because of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_overview.html#blastq" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">QBLAST</ext-link>system.

						<title>BLAST Scores and Statistics</title>
						<p>
							Once BLAST has found a similar sequence to the query in the database, it is helpful to have some idea of whether the alignment is good and whether it portrays a possible biological relationship, or whether the similarity observed is attributable to chance alone. BLAST uses <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">statistical theory</ext-link>to produce a bit scoreand expect value (E-value) for each alignment pair (query to hit).
						</p>
						<p>
							The bit score gives an indication of how good the alignment is; the higher the score, the better the alignment. In general terms, this score is calculated from a formula that takes into account the alignment of similar or identical residues, as well as any gaps introduced to align the sequences. A key element in this calculation is the substitution matrix, which assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues. The BLOSUM62matrix is the default for most BLAST programs, the exceptions being blastn and MegaBLAST (programs that perform nucleotidenucleotide comparisons and hence do not use protein-specific matrices). Bit scores are normalized, which means that the bit scores from different alignments can be compared, even if different scoring matrices have been used.
						</p>
						<p>
							The E-value gives an indication of the statistical significance of a given pairwise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system used. The lower the E-value, the more significant the hit. A sequence alignment that has an E-value of 0.05 means that this similarity has a 5 in 100 (1 in 20) chance of occurring by chance alone. Although a statistician might consider this to be significant, it still may not represent a biologically meaningful result, and analysis of the alignments (see below) is required to determine biological significance.

						<title>BLAST Output: 1. The Traditional Report</title>
						<p>
							Most BLAST users are familiar with the so-called traditional BLAST report. The report consists of three major sections: (1) the header, which contains information about the query sequence, the database searched (Figure 2). On the Web, there is also a graphical overview (Figure 3); (2) the one-line descriptions of each database sequence found to match the query sequence; these provide a quick overview for browsing (Figure 4); (3) the alignments for each database sequence matched (Figure 5) (there may be more than one alignment for a database sequence it matches).

This usually includes information on the organism from which the sequence was derived, the type of sequence (e.g., mRNA or DNA), and some information about function or phenotype. The definition line is often truncated in the one-line descriptions to keep the display compact; ( <italic>c</italic>) the alignment score in bits.

							The traditional report is really designed for human readability, as opposed to being parsed by a program. For example, the one-line descriptions are useful for people to get a quick overview of their search results, but they are rarely complete descriptors because of limited space. Also, for convenience, there are several pieces of information that are displayed in both the one-line descriptions and alignments (for example, the E-values, scores, and descriptions); therefore, the person viewing the search output does not need to move back and forth between sections.
						</p>
						<p>
							New features may be added to the report, e.g., the addition of links to LocusLink records (Chapter 19) from sequence hits, which result in a change of output format. These are easy for people to pick up on and take advantage of but can trip programs that parse this BLAST output.
						</p>
						<p>
							By default, a maximum of 500 sequence matches are displayed, which can be changed on the advanced BLAST page with the  Alignments option. Many components of the BLAST results display via the Internet and are hyperlinked to the same information at different places in the page, to additional information including help documentation, and to the Entrez sequence records of matched sequences. These records provide more information about the sequence, including links to relevant research abstracts in PubMed.

						<title>BLAST Output: 2. The Hit Table</title>
						<p>
							Although the traditional report is ideal for investigating the characteristics of one gene or protein, often scientists want to make a large number of BLAST runs for a specialized purpose and need only a subset of the information contained in the traditional BLAST report. Furthermore, in cases where the BLAST output will be processed further, it can be unreliable to parse the traditional report. The traditional report is merely a display format with no formal structure or rules, and improvements may be made at any time, changing the underlying HTML. The hit table format provides a simple and clean alternative (Figure 6).

						</p>
						<p>
							The screening of many newly sequenced human Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) for contamination by the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>cloning vector is a good example of when it is preferable to use the hit table output over the traditional report. In this case, a strict, high E-value threshold would be applied to differentiate between contaminating <italic>E. coli</italic>sequence and the human sequence. Those human ESTs that find very strong, near-exact <italic>E.coli</italic>sequence matches can be discarded without further examination. (Borderline cases may require further examination by a scientist.)
						</p>
						<p>
							For these purposes, the hit table output is more useful than the traditional report; it contains only the information required in a more formal structure. The hit table output contains no sequences or definition lines, but for each sequence matched, it lists the sequence identifier, the start and stop points for stretches of sequence similarity (offset by one residue), the percent identity of the match, and the E-value.

						<title>BLAST Output: 3. Structured Output</title>
						<p>
							There are drawbacks to parsing both the BLAST report and even the simpler hit table. There is no way to automatically check for truncated or otherwise corrupted output in cases when a large number of sequences are being screened. (This may happen if the disk is full, for example.) Also, there is no rigorous check for syntax changes in the output, such as the addition of new features, which can lead to erroneous parsing. Structured output allows for automatic and rigorous checks for syntax errors and changes. Both XMLand ASN.1are examples of structured output in which there are built-in checks for correct and complete syntax and structure. (In the case of XML, for example, this is ensured by the necessity for matching tags and the DTD.) For text reports, there is often no specification, but perhaps a (incomplete) description of the file is written afterward.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.623">
							<title>ASN.1 Is Used by the BLAST Server</title>
							<p>
								As well as the hit table and traditional report shown in HTML, BLAST results can also be formatted in plain text, XML, and ASN.1 (  Figure 7), and what's more, the format for a given BLAST result can be changed without re-executing the search.

										<title>The different output formats that can be produced from ASN.1.</title>

								</fig>
							</p>
							<p>
								A change in BLAST format without re-executing the search is possible because when a scientist looks at a Web page of BLAST results at NCBI, the HTML that makes that page has been created from ASN.1 (  Figure 7). Although the formatted results are requested from the server, the information about the alignments is fetched from a disk in ASN.1, as are the corresponding sequences from the BLAST databases (see   Figure 1). The formatter on the BLAST server then puts these results together as a BLAST report. The BLAST search itself has been uncoupled from the way the result is formatted, thus allowing different output formats from the same search. The strict internal validation of ASN.1 ensures that these output formats can always be produced reliably.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.625">
							<title>Information about the Alignment Is Contained within a SeqAlign</title>
							<p>
								SeqAlign is the ASN.1 object that contains the alignment information about the BLAST search. The SeqAlign does not contain the actual sequence that was found in the match but does contain the start, stop, and gap information, as well as scores, E-values, sequence identifiers, and (DNA) strand information.
							</p>
							<p>
								As mentioned above, the actual database sequences are fetched from the BLAST databases when needed. This means that an identifier must uniquely identify a sequence in the database. Furthermore, the query sequence cannot have the same identifier as any sequence in the database unless the query sequence itself is in the database. If one is using stand-alone BLAST with a custom database, it is possible to specify that every sequence is uniquely identified by using the    O option with formatdb (the program that converts FASTA files to BLAST database format). This also indexes the entries by identifier. Similarly, the    J option in the (stand-alone) programs blastall, blastpgp, megablast, or rpsblast certifies that the query does not use an identifier already in the database for a different sequence. If the    O and    J options are not used, BLAST assigns unique identifiers (for that run) to all sequences and shields the user from this knowledge.
							</p>
							<p>
								Any BLAST database or FASTA file from the NCBI Web site that contains gi numbers already satisfies the uniqueness criterion. Unique identifiers are normally a problem only when custom databases are produced and care is not taken in assigning identifiers. The identifier for a FASTA entry is the first token (meaning the letters up to the first space) after the &gt; sign on the definition line. The simplest case is to simply have a unique token (e.g., 1, 2, and so on), but it is possible to construct more complicated identifiers that might, for example, describe the data source. For the FASTA identifiers to be reliably parsed, it is necessary for them to follow a specific syntax (see Appendix 1).
							</p>
							<p>
								More information on the SeqAlign produced by BLAST can be found   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="presentation in html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">here</ext-link>or be downloaded as a   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href=" ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/demo/blast_programming.ppt" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PowerPoint presentation</ext-link>, as well as from the NCBI Toolkit Software Developer's   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/INDEX.HTML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">handbook</ext-link>.

						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.626">
							<title>XML</title>
							<p>
								XML and ASN.1 are both structured languages and can express the same information; therefore, it is possible to produce a SeqAlign in XML. Some users do not find the format of the information in the SeqAlign to be convenient because it does not contain actual sequence information, and when the sequence is fetched from the BLAST database, it is packed two or four bases per byte. Typically, these users are familiar with the BLAST report and want something similar but in a format that can be parsed reliably. The XML produced by BLAST meets this need, containing the query and database sequences, sequence definition lines, the start and stop points of the alignments (one offset), as well as scores, E-values, and percent identity. There is a public   <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/NCBI_BlastOutput.mod" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">DTD</ext-link>for this XML output.

						<title>BLAST Code</title>
						<p>
							The BLAST code is part of the NCBI Toolkit, which has many low-level functions to make it platform independent; the Toolkit is supported under Linux and many varieties of UNIX, NT, and MacOS. To use the Toolkit, developers should write a function Main, which is called by the Toolkit main. The BLAST code is contained mostly in the tools directory (see Appendix 2 for an example).
						</p>
						<p>
							The BLAST code has a modular design. For example, the Application Programming Interface (API) for retrieval from the BLAST databases is independent of the compute engine. The compute engine is independent from the formatter; therefore, it is possible (as mentioned above) to compute results once but view them in many different modes.

								The readdb API can be used to easily extract information from the BLAST databases. Among the data available are the date the database was produced, the title, the number of letters, number of sequences, and the longest sequence. Also available are the sequence and description of any entry. The latest version of the BLAST databases also contains a taxid (an integer specifying some node of the NCBI taxonomy tree; see   Chapter 4). Users are strongly encouraged to use the readdb API rather than reading the files associated with the database, because the the files are subject to change. The API, on the other hand, will support the newest version, and an attempt will be made to support older versions. See Appendix 2 for an example of a simple program (db2fasta.c) that demonstrates the use of the readdb API.

							The syntax of the FASTA definition lines used in the NCBI BLAST databases depends upon the database from which each sequence was obtained (see Chapter 1on GenBank). Table 1shows how the sequence source databases are identified.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if the identifier of a sequence in a BLAST result is gb|M73307|AGMA13GT, the gb tag indicates that sequence is from GenBank, M73307 is the GenBank Accession number, and AGMA13GT is the GenBank locus.
						</p>
						<p>
							The bar (|) separates different fields. In some cases, a field is left empty, although the original specification called for including this field. To make these identifiers backwards-compatible for older parsers, the empty field is denoted by an additional bar (||).
						</p>
						<p>
							A gi identifier has been assigned to each sequence in NCBI's sequence databases. If the sequence is from an NCBI database, then the gi number appears at the beginning of the identifier in a traditional report. For example, gi|16760827|ref|NP_456444.1 indicates an NCBI reference sequence with the gi number 16760827 and Accession number NP_456444.1. (In stand-alone BLAST, or when running BLAST from the command line, the  I option should be used to display the gi number.)
						</p>
						<p>
							The reason for adding the gi identifier is to provide a uniform, stable naming convention. If a nucleotide or protein sequence changes (for example, if it is edited by the original submitter of the sequence), a new gi identifier is assigned, but the Accession number of the record remains unchanged. Thus, the gi identifier provides a mechanism for identifying the exact sequence that was used or retrieved in a given search. This is also useful when creating crosslinks between different Entrez databases (Chapter 15).

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							The task of assembling an inventory of all genes of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>and other organisms began more than a decade ago with large-scale survey sequencing of transcribed sequences. The resulting Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were a gold mine of novel gene sequences that provided an infrastructure for additional large-scale projects, such as gene maps, expression systems, and full-length cDNA projects. In addition, untold numbers of targeted gene-hunting projects have benefited from the availability of these sequences and the physical clone reagents. However, the high level of redundancy found among transcribed sequences, not to mention a variety of common experimental artifacts, made it difficult for many people to make effective use of the data. This problem was the motivation for the development of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">UniGene</ext-link>, a largely automated analytical system for producing an organized view of the transcriptome. In this chapter, we discuss the properties of the input sequences, the process by which they are analyzed in UniGene, and some pointers on how to use the resource.

						<p>
							At a time when the genomes of many species have been sequenced completely, a fundamental resource expected by many researchers is a simple list of all of an organism's genes. A gene list, together with associated physical reagents and electronic information, allows one to begin to investigate the ways in which many genes interact in the complex system of the organism. However, many species of medical and agricultural importance have not yet been prioritized for genomic sequencing, and expressed cDNAs have provided the primary source of gene sequences. Furthermore, when the genomic sequence of an organism becomes available, a collection of cDNA sequences provides the best tool for identifying genes within the DNA sequence. Thus, we can anticipate that the sequencing of transcribed products will remain a significant area of interest well into the future.
						</p>
						<p>
							The era of high-throughput cDNA sequencing was initiated in 1991 by a landmark study from Venter and his colleagues (
							1). The basic strategy involves selecting cDNA clones at random and performing a single, automated, sequencing read from one or both ends of their inserts. They introduced the term EST to refer to this new class of sequence, which is characterized by being short (typically about 400600 bases) and relatively inaccurate (around 2% error). The use of single-pass sequencing was an important aspect of making the approach cost effective. In most cases, there is no initial attempt to identify or characterize the clones. Instead, they are identified using only the small bit of sequence data obtained, comparing it to the sequences of known genes and other ESTs. It is fully expected that many clones will be redundant with others already sampled and that a smaller number will represent various sorts of contaminants or cloning artifacts. There is little point in incurring the expense of high-quality sequencing until later in the process, when clones can be validated and a non-redundant set selected.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite their fragmentary and inaccurate nature, ESTs were found to be an invaluable resource for the discovery of new genes, particularly those involved in human disease processes (
							2, 
							3). After the initial demonstration of the utility and cost effectiveness of the EST approach, many similar projects were initiated, resulting in an ever-increasing number of human ESTs (
							48). In addition, large-scale EST projects were launched for several other organisms of experimental interest. In 1992, a database called dbEST (
							9) was established to serve as a collection point for ESTs, which are then distributed to the scientific community as the EST division of GenBank (10). The EST division continues to dominate GenBank, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all submissions. The 20 organisms with the largest numbers of ESTs in the public database (as of March 7, 2002) are shown in Table 1

							One avenue to gene discovery is to use a database search tool, such as BLAST (11), to perform a sequence similarity search against dbEST. The query for such a search would be a gene or protein sequence, perhaps from a model organism, that is expected to be related to the human gene of interest. Because clone identifiers are carried with the sequence tags, it is possible to obtain the original material to generate a more accurate sequence or to use as an experimental reagent. For many EST projects, the IMAGE consortium (12) has been particularly instrumental in collecting the cDNA libraries, arraying the clones, and making the clones available for sequencing and redistribution.
						</p>
						<p>
							For EST sequencing to be maximally productive, certain details of the library construction require some attention. For example, normalization procedures have been used to reduce the abundance of highly expressed genes so as to favor the sampling of rarer transcripts (13). More recently, subtraction techniques have been used to construct libraries depleted of clones already subjected to EST sampling (14). Although these techniques make it more efficient to find transcripts that are at low abundance in a particular tissue, it is possible that a small number of genes will still be missed because they are simply not expressed in tissues, cell types, and developmental stages that have been sampled.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although ESTs are a useful way to identify clones of interest and provide guidance in identifying gene structure, a full-insert sequence of cDNA clones is preferable for both purposes. High-throughput full-insert cDNA sequencing projects have been the source of over 80,000 sequence submissions accessioned to date (August 2002). The full-insert cDNA sequence can allow identification of the translation product of the sequenced transcript, as well as potentially providing evidence for gene structure. Moreover, for the investigator wanting to use the clone as a reagent, having the accurate and complete sequence of the clone's insert at hand makes complete resequencing unnecessary, if the full-insert cDNA sequencing project makes clones available. Verifying that the full-insert sequence corresponds to either the complete transcript of interest or to its complete, uncorrupted coding sequence is possible without committing laboratory resources and time to a clone that produced an EST. cDNA libraries do not generally include the entire transcript sequence; therefore, many full-insert sequences do not contain the entire transcription unit. Large transcripts (&gt;6 kb) are particularly difficult to obtain.

						<title>Sequence Clusters</title>
						<p>
							The sheer number of transcribed sequences is extraordinary, indeed for most organisms much larger than the number of genes. A major challenge is to make putative gene assignments for these sequences, recognizing that many of these genes will be anonymous, defined only by the sequences themselves. Computationally, this can be thought of as a clustering problem in which the sequences are vertices that may be coalesced into clusters by establishing connections among them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Experience has shown that it is important to eliminate low-quality or apparently artifactual sequences before clustering because even a small level of noise can have a large corrupting effect on a result. Thus, procedures are in place to eliminate sequences of foreign origin (most commonly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) and identify regions that are derived from the cloning vector or artificial primers or linkers. At present, UniGene focuses on protein-coding genes of the nuclear genome; therefore, those identified as rRNA or mitochondrial sequence are eliminated. Through the NCBI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Trace Archive</ext-link>, an increasing number of EST sequences now have base-level error probabilities that are used to identify the highest quality segment of each sequence. Repetitive sequences sometimes lead to false alignments and must be treated with caution. Simple repeats (low-complexity regions) are identified using a word-overrepresentation algorithm called DUST, and transposable repetitive elements are identified by comparison with a library of known repeats for each organism. Rather than eliminating them outright, subsequences classified as repetitive are soft-masked, which is to say that they are not allowed to initiate a sequence alignment, although they may participate in one that is triggered within a unique sequence. For a sequence to be included in UniGene, the clone insert must have at least 100 base pairs that are of high quality and not repetitive.
						</p>
						<p>
							With a given a set of sequences, a variety of different sources of information may be used as evidence that any pair of them is or is not derived from the same gene. The most obvious type of relationship would be one in which the sequences overlap and can form a near-perfect sequence alignment. One dilemma is that some level of mismatching should be tolerated because of known levels of base substitution errors in ESTs, whereas allowing too much mismatching will cause highly similar paralogous genes to cluster together. One way to improve the results is to require that alignments show an approximate dovetail relationship, which is to say that they extend about as far to the ends of the sequences as possible. Values of specific parameters governing acceptable sequence alignments are chosen by examining ratios of true to false connections in curated test sets. It is important to note that the resulting clusters may contain more than one alternative-splice form.
						</p>
						<p>
							Multiple incomplete but non-overlapping fragments of the same gene are frequently recognized in hindsight when the gene's complete sequence is submitted. To minimize the frequency of multiple clusters being identified for a single gene, UniGene clusters are required to contain at least one sequence carrying readily identifiable evidence of having reached the 3 terminus. In other words, UniGene clusters must be anchored at the 3 end of a transcription unit. This evidence can be either a canonical polyadenylation signal (15) or the presence of a poly(A) tail on the transcript, or the presence of at least two ESTs labeled as having been generated using the 3 sequencing primer. Because some clusters do not contain such evidence (typically, they are single ESTs), not all uncontaminated sequences in dbEST appear in UniGene clusters. Of unit, alternatively spliced terminal 3 exons will appear as distinct clusters until sequence that spans the distinct splice forms is submitted. With the availability of genome sequence, a more stringent test of 3 anchoring is possible, because internal priming can be recognized. Clusters that satisfy this more-stringent requirement can be identified by adding the term has_end to any query. Specific query possibilities such as this one are listed under the rubric <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/query.cgi" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Query Tips</ext-link>on the UniGene homepage.

							The UniGene Web site allows the user to view UniGene information on a per cluster, per sequence, or per library basis. Each UniGene Web page (Figure 1) includes a header with a query bar and a sidebar providing links to related online resources.

						<title>UniGene Cluster Browser</title>
						<p>
							The UniGene Cluster page summarizes the sequences in the cluster and a variety of derived information that may be used to infer the identity of the gene. Figure 1shows an example of such a view for the human <italic>SERPINF2</italic>gene. When available, links are provided to a corresponding entry in other NCBI resources (e.g., LocusLink, OMIM) or external databases [e.g., Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) at the Jackson Laboratory and the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) at the University of Oregon]. Additional sections on the page provide protein similarities, mapping data, expression information, and lists of the clustered sequences.
						</p>
						<p>
							Possible protein products for the gene are suggested by providing protein similarities between one representative sequence from the cluster and protein sequences from eight selected model organisms. For each organism, the protein with the highest degree of sequence similarity to the nucleotide sequence is listed, with its title and GenBank Accession number. The sequence alignment is described using the percent identity and length of the aligned region. Also provided is a link to ProtEST, which summarizes the UniGene protein similarities on a per protein basis.
						</p>
						<p>
							The next section summarizes information on the inferred map position of the gene. In some cases, chromosome assignments can be drawn from other databases, such as OMIM or MGI. In other cases, radiation hybrid (RH) maps have been constructed using Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers derived from ESTs. In these cases, the UniGene cluster can be associated with a marker in the UniSTS database, and a map position can be assigned from the RH map. More recently, map positions have been derived by alignment of the cDNA sequences to the finished or draft genomic sequences present in the NCBI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MapViewer</ext-link>. For example, the <italic>SERPINF2</italic>gene in Figure 1has a link to human chromosome 17 in the Map Viewer. The map is initially shown with a few selected tracks that are likely to be of interest, but others may be added by the user.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although ESTs are a poor probe of gene expression, both the total number of ESTs and the tissues from which they originated are often useful. Both of these are displayed in the cluster browser. The tissues are listed under Expression Information, which includes the tissue source of libraries of the component sequences and, for human, links to the SAGE resource. Moreover, if genomic sequence is available, the UniGene map view displays expression for each exon (more precisely, for each portion of genome similar to a transcript; because incompletely processed mRNAs are not unheard of, the presence of a transcript is insufficient to identify an exon).
						</p>
						<p>
							The component sequences of the cluster are listed, with a brief description of each one and a link to its UniGene Sequence page. The Sequence page provides more detailed information about the individual sequence, and in the case of ESTs, includes a link to its corresponding UniGene Library page. On the Cluster page, the EST clones that are considered by the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project to be putatively full length are listed at the top, whereas others follow in order of their reported insert length. At the bottom of the UniGene Cluster page is an option for the user to download the sequences of the cluster in FASTA format.

The BLASTX program has been used to compare each sequence in UniGene to selected protein sequences drawn from eight model organisms: <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. These species were chosen as spanning a variety of taxonomic classes, as well as being well represented in the protein databases. To exclude proteins that are strictly conceptual translations and models, the proteins used in ProtEST are those originating from the RefSeq, SWISS-PROT, PIR, PDB, or PRF databases.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ProtEST Web site has three features: information describing the amino acid sequence; information describing the nucleotideprotein alignments; and the ability for the user to modify various display options. The sequence alignments in ProtEST are summarized in tabular form (Figure 2). The first column is a schematic representation of the nucleotideprotein alignment. The width of the column represents the entire length of the protein, whereas the unaligned nucleotide sequence is represented as a thin gray line and the aligned region is represented as a thick magenta bar. The alignment representation is a hyperlink to the full alignment regenerated on-the-fly using BLAST. Other information in the table includes the frame and strand of the alignment, a link to the corresponding trace as provided in the NCBI Trace Archive, the UniGene cluster ID, the GenBank Accession number, and columns that describe the aligned region and percent identity.

						<title>Digital Differential Display (DDD)</title>
						<p>
							DDD is a tool for comparing EST-based expression profiles among the various libraries, or pools of libraries, represented in UniGene. These comparisons allow the identification of those genes that differ among libraries of different tissues, making it possible to determine which genes may be contributing to a cell's unique characteristics, e.g., those that make a muscle cell different from a skin or liver cell. Along similar lines, DDD can be used to try to identify genes for which the expression levels differ between normal, premalignant, and cancerous tissues or different stages of embryonic development.
						</p>
						<p>
							As in UniGene, the DDD resource is organism specific and is available from the UniGene <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Web site</ext-link>for that organism. For those libraries that have sequences in UniGene, DDD lists the title and tissue source and provides a link to the UniGene Library page, which gives additional information about the library. From the libraries listed, the user can select two for comparison. DDD then displays those genes for which the frequency of the transcript is significantly different between the two libraries. The output includes, for each gene, the frequency of its transcript in each library and the title of the gene's corresponding UniGene cluster. Results are sorted by significance, with the genes having the largest differences in frequencies displayed at the top. Libraries can be added sequentially to the analysis, and DDD will perform an analysis on each possible librarygene pair combination. Similarly, groups of libraries can be pooled together and compared with other pools or single libraries.
						</p>
						<p>
							DDD uses the Fisher Exact test to restrict the output to statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic>0.05). The analysis is also restricted to deeply sequenced libraries; only those with over 1000 sequences in UniGene are included in DDD. These requirements place limitations on the capabilities of the analysis. Unless there are a large number of sequences in each pool, the frequencies of genes are generally not found to be statistically significant. Furthermore, the wide variety of tissue types, cell types, histology, and methods of generating the libraries can make it difficult to attribute significant differences to any one aspect of the libraries. These issues underscore the need for more libraries to be made public and the need for the comparisons to be made using proper controls. Libaries generated by the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CGAP</ext-link>) will become especially valuable to this end. This project has resulted in a plethora of human libraries made from a variety of tissue types and generated using a variety of methods.

						<title>HomoloGene</title>
						<p>
							HomoloGene is a resource for exploring putative homology relationships among genes, bringing together curated homology information and results from automated sequence comparisons. UniGene clusters, supplemented by data from genome sequencing projects, have been used as a source of gene sequences for automated comparisons.
						</p>
						<p>
							Homology relationships, according to the experts who judge these, have been obtained from several sources. Collaborations with MGI and ZFIN at the University of Oregon have provided a large body of literature-derived data centered around <italic>M. musculus</italic>and <italic>D. rerio</italic>, respectively. Ortholog pairs involving sequences from <italic>H. sapiens</italic>and <italic>M. musculus</italic>have been imported from the NCBI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Homology/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">HumanMouse Homology Map</ext-link>. Additional information has been extracted from the literature by NCBI staff specifically for the HomoloGene project.
						</p>
						<p>
							MegaBLAST (16) is used to perform cross-species sequence alignments and to identify those sequence pairs that share high degrees of nucleotide similarity. For each sequence, its best alignment with the sequences of the other organisms is retained. However, the best match for a sequence is not necessarily the best match for its partner sequence. For example, if there are several more sequences representing a particular gene in one organism than in the other organism, several sequences in one organism might have the same best match in the less well-represented organism. Similarly, if there are several paralogous genes in one species, they may find one identical homologous gene in another species. HomoloGene discriminates one-way best matches from cases where two sequences are each other's best match, or reciprocal best matches, and only these reciprocal best matches are used. These sequence pairs are then used to find cross-species homologies between UniGene clusters. When reciprocal best matches are consistent between three or more organisms, the pair is described as being part of a consistent triplet.
						</p>
						<p>
							The connections made by these methods result in a complex web of relationships. To simplify the Web view, it is useful to have each report page focus on an individual gene, called the key gene, and to show connections that follow from it. An example of the report for the <italic>M. musculus Serpinf2</italic>gene is shown in Figure 3. The title of this key gene is shown at the top of the page, followed by genes from other species that show reciprocal best match relationships to the key gene. Each of these may have hypertext links to provide additional biological information about the gene. This is followed by a section providing the curated homology information (if any), with links to the source of the data. Reciprocal best-match relationships are listed in the next two sections, first those directly involving the key gene and then those from a second round of walking that may be of interest. In each case, the description includes the sequence identifiers and percent identity of the alignment, with a hyperlink to reproduce a full alignment using BLAST.

						<title>Summary</title>
						<p>
							The protein database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) is an attempt to phylogenetically classify the complete complement of proteins (both predicted and characterized) encoded by complete genomes. Each COG is a group of three or more proteins that are inferred to be orthologs, i.e., they are direct evolutionary counterparts. The current release of the COGs database consists of 4,873 COGs, which include 136,711 proteins (~71% of all encoded proteins) from 50 bacterial genomes, 13 archaeal genomes, and 3 genomes of unicellular eukaryotes, the yeasts <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and the microsporidian <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>. The COG database is updated periodically as new genomes become available. The COGs for complete eukaryotic genomes are in preparation. The COGs can be applied to the task of functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes by using the COGnitor program, which is available on the COGs <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">homepage</ext-link>.

						<title>Introduction</title>
						<p>
							The recent progress in genome sequencing has led to a rapid enrichment of protein databases with an unprecedented variety of deduced protein sequences, most of them without a documented functional role. Computational biology strives to extract the maximal possible information from these sequences by classifying them according to their homologousrelationships, predicting their likely biochemical activities and/or cellular functions, three-dimensional structures, and evolutionary origin. This challenge is daunting, given that even in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, arguably the best-studied organism, only about 40% of the gene products have been characterized experimentally. However, computational analysis of complete microbial genomes has shown that prokaryotic proteins are, in general, highly conserved, with about 70% of them containing ancient conserved regions shared by homologs from distantly related species. This allows one to use functional information from experimentally characterized proteins to suggest function in their homologs from poorly studied organisms. For such functional predictions to be reliable, it is critical to infer orthologous relationships between genes from different species. Orthologs are evolutionary counterparts related by vertical descent (i.e., they have evolved from a common ancestor) as opposed to, which are genes related by duplication (
							1, 
							2). Typically, orthologous proteins have the same domain architecture and the same function, although there are significant exceptions and complications to this generalization, particularly among multicellular eukaryotes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The COGs database has been designed as an attempt to classify proteins from completely sequenced genomes on the basis of the orthology concept (
							35). The COGs reflect one-to-many and many-to-many orthologous relationships as well as simple one-to-one relationships (hence, orthologous groups of proteins). In addition to the classification itself, the COGs Web site includes the COGnitor program, which assigns proteins from newly sequenced genomes to COGs that already exist and to several functionalities that allow the user to select and analyze various subsets of COGs.

						<title>Construction of the COGs</title>
						<p>
							COGs have been identified on the basis of an all-against-all sequence comparison of the proteins encoded in complete genomes using the gapped BLAST program (
							6; see also Chapter 16) after masking low-complexity (
							7) and predicted coiled-coil (
							8) regions. The COG construction procedure is based on the simple notion that any group of at least three proteins from distant genomes that are more similar to each other than they are to any other proteins from the same genomes are most likely to form an orthologous set (Figure 1). This prediction holds even if the absolute level of sequence similarity between the proteins in question is relatively low, and thus the COG approach accommodates both slow-evolving and fast-evolving genes.

										Perform a case-by-case analysis of each COG. This analysis serves to eliminate false-positives and to identify groups that contain multidomain proteins by examining the pictorial representation of the BLAST search outputs. The sequences of detected multidomain proteins are split into single-domain segments, and steps 14 are repeated with the resulting shorter sequences, which assigns individual domains to COGs in accordance with their distinct evolutionary affinities.

									<p>
										Examine large COGs that include multiple members from all or several of the genomes using phylogenetic trees, cluster analysis, and visual inspection of alignments. As a result, some of these groups are split into two or more smaller ones that are included in the final set of COGs.
									</p>
								</list-item>
							</list>
						</p>
						<p>
							By the design of this procedure, a minimal COG includes three genes from distinct phylogenetic lineages; protein sets from closely related species were merged before COG construction. The approach used for the construction of COGs does not supplant a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, it provides a fast and convenient shortcut to delineate a large number of families that most likely consist of orthologs.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.895">
							<title>The COGnitor Program</title>
							<p>
								New proteins can be assigned to the COGs using the COGnitor program, the principal tool associated with the COGs database. COGnitor BLASTs the query sequences against all protein sequences encoded in the genomes that are classified in the current release of the COG system. To assign proteins to COGs, COGnitor applies the same principle that is embedded in the COG construction procedure, i.e., the consistency of genome-specific BeTs. For any given query protein, if the number of BeTs for a particular COG exceeds a predefined cut-off (three by default; the cut-off value can be changed by the user), the query protein is assigned to that COG; in cases where there are more than three BeTs to two different COGs, an ambiguous result is reported.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.896">
							<title>The Current State of the COGs Database, Updates, and Additional Classification of the COGs</title>
							<p>
								Once the COGs have been identified using the above procedure, new members can be added using the COGnitor program. The assignments are further checked and curated by hand to eliminate potential false-positives. It has been shown that 9597% of the COGnitor assignments typically require no correction (  
								9). Once the proteins from a new genome are assigned to the appropriate pre-existing COGs through this combination of COGnitor and manual refinement, the remaining proteins from this genome are compared to the proteins from non-COG proteins from previously available genomes, and an attempt is made to construct new COGs using the original procedure. In addition, when new sequences are added to an exisiting COG, the COG is examined for the possibility of a split (isolation of a new COG) by inspecting BLAST search outputs for all COG members and, in some cases, phylogenetic tree analysis. Thus, the number of COGs continuously grows through the construction of new COGs that typically include just a small number of species, whereas the number of proteins in the COG system increases primarily through the addition of new members to pre-existing COGs.
							</p>
							<p>
								In bacterial and archaeal genomes, approximately 70% of the proteins typically belong to the COGs. Because each COG includes proteins from at least three distantly related species, this reveals the generally high level of evolutionary conservation of protein sequences, making the COGs a powerful tool for functional annotation of uncharacterized proteins. The COGs were classified into 18 functional categories that loosely follow those introduced by Riley (  10) and also include a class for which only a general functional prediction (e.g., that of biochemical activity) was feasible, as well as a class of uncharacterized COGs. A significant majority of the COGs could be assigned to one of the well-defined functional categories, but the single largest class includes the functionally uncharacterized COGs. Additionally, the COGs were clustered according to the common metabolic pathways and macromolecular complexes.

						<title>Phyletic Pattern Analysis in COGs</title>
						<p>
							A phyletic pattern is the pattern of species that are represented or not represented in a given COG; alternatively, phyletic patterns can be described in terms of the sets of COGs that are represented in a given range of species. The COGs show a broad diversity of phyletic patterns; only a small fraction are universal COGs, i.e., they are represented in all sequenced genomes, whereas COGs present in only three or four species are most abundant. This patchy distribution of phyletic patterns probably reflects the major role of horizontal gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss in the evolution of prokaryotes, as well as the rapid evolution of certain genes in specific lineages, which may be linked to functional changes. Phyletic patterns are informative not only as indicators of probable evolutionary scenarios but also functionally; most often, different steps of the same pathway are associated with proteins that have the same phyletic pattern, whereas on some occasions, complementary patterns indicate that distinct (sometimes unrelated) proteins are responsible for the same function in different sets of species. The COG system includes a simple phyletic pattern search tool that allows the selection of COGs according to any given pattern of species. This tool effectively provides the functionality of differential genome display (for example, allowing the selection of all COGs that are present in one, but not the other, of a pair of genomes of interest) and can be helpful for delineating sets of candidate proteins for a particular range of functional features, e.g., virulence or hyperthermophily.

						<title>Future Directions</title>
						<p>
							Substantial evolution of the COGs is expected in the near future in terms of both growth by adding more genomes and the addition of new functionalities and layers of presentation. Quantitatively, the main forthcoming addition is the COGs for eukaryotic genomes, which are expected to approximately double the size of the COG system. Many of the COGs include paralogous proteins, and this will be addressed by introducing hierarchical organization into the COG system, whereby related COGs will be unified at a higher level. In addition, partial integration of the COGs with the NCBI's Conserved Domains Database (CDD) is expected (Chapter 3), which will result in a more flexible and informative representation of the domain organization of proteins and of structural information that is available for COG members.

							<title>The Help Desk</title>
							<p>
								Help Desk assistance is available from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. Two email addresses are available, info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and blast-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The 
								<email>info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>address is for any type of inquiry, including questions about services; how to get started using the NCBI tools for a particular research problem; reports of technical problems; press inquiries; and comments or suggestions about NCBI resources. The <email>blast-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>address is for questions and comments regarding sequence similarity searches using BLAST tools and databases. The Help Desk phone number is 301-496-2475.
							</p>
							<p>
								email questions are answered as expeditiously as possible, usually within a day of receipt of the question. However, those that require extended investigation may take longer. Questions are usually handled directly by members of the User Services staff, although some are referred to a specific database development team for attention.
							</p>
							<p>
								Examples of question topics include: data submission protocols, including the use of   BankItand   Sequin(  Chapter 12); finding summary information about a gene or disease; using   Entrez(  Chapter 15) to find sequence records for genes and proteins; choosing the best   BLASTservice to use for a particular application (  Chapter 16); how to interpret BLAST results; how to display and manipulate three-dimensional structures with   Cn3D(  Chapter 3); how to display genome data using the   Map Viewer(  Chapter 20); how to print or save search output; how to set up sequence databases and install NCBI software locally; and which databases to use for a specific research question. We also accept reports of possible data errors, suggestions of new features or content to include in databases, and reports of system bugs or Web problems. The NCBI also receives a number of press inquiries about the research applications of our services, bioinformatics in general, and various genome projects. Occasionally, a high-school student will submit questions for a classroom assignment, providing a special outreach opportunity to young scientists.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because of the genetic focus of many of NCBI resources, we receive a number of questions from the general public regarding medical issues. The NCBI Help Desk staff can neither provide direct answers to medical questions nor give medical advice or guidance. However, we do provide suggestions on how to search our resources for information on the gene or condition of interest and refer users to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) customer service group for further assistance with PubMed (  Chapter 2),   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MEDLINEplus</ext-link>, and   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>. We also refer them to outside organizations that can provide information on such topics as support groups and sources of medical advice.
							</p>
							<p>
								Questions about   PubMedare handled by a separate customer service group within the NLM. Their direct address is  
								<email>custserv@nlm.nih.gov</email>, and their phone number is 1-888-FIND-NLM. PubMed questions that are received at the NCBI Help Desk are forwarded to NLM.

Additional problem-oriented mini-units are under development.
							</p>
							<p>
								The units are 2 hours each in length. An overview is given during the first hour in lecture format, followed by a 1-hour hands-on session. Although primarily given on the NIH campus, NCBI is beginning to offer these workshops at outside institutions as well. Although the mini-units were originally designed to be presented by an instructor, they are constructed in an online notebook format; therefore, it is possible to take the unit on your own. Revisions to augment the online notebooks with lecture material and make the units completely self-guided are currently under way.

									<bold>BLAST QuickStart!</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									This mini-unit is a practical introduction to the BLAST family of sequence-similarity search programs. Exercises range from simple searches to creative uses of the BLAST programs.

							<sec id="bid.930">
								<title>
									<bold>Unmasking Genes in the Human Genome</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									This mini-unit covers how to find genes, promoters, and transcription factor-binding sites in human DNA sequences. It is designed around a program developed within User Services called Greengene, which integrates the output of several gene-finding tools and allows a coding sequence and accompanying protein translation to be assembled from the exons detected by these programs. Because the output of several programs is integrated, there is increased reliability in exon selection.

								<title>
									<bold>Making Sense of DNA and Protein Sequences</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									In this unit, participants find a gene within a eukaryotic DNA sequence. They then predict the function of the derived protein by seeking sequence similarities to proteins with documented function using BLAST and other tools. Finally, a 3D modeling template is located for the protein sequence using the Conserved Domain Search (CDD-Search).
								</p>
								<p>
									During the first hour, an instructor walks the class through an analysis of an uncharacterized <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>genomic sequence from a GenBank record. During the second hour, participants perform the same analysis independently, using a different genomic sequence.

									<bold>GenBank and PubMed Searching</bold>
								</title>
								<p>
									This mini-unit provides an overview of literature searching and sequence retrieval using the PubMed and Entrez database search interfaces. Exercises illustrate advanced search tips for using Entrez, many of which explore the use of the  Preview/Index options for specifying parameters to limit the search results. The unit also features 21 self-scoring exercises for GenBank.

							An innovative training program that began in 2001 aims to train molecular biologists for a new type of career as bioinformatics specialists who provide institutional support for users of computational biology tools. The NCBI Core Bioinformatics Facility (referred to as the CoreBio program) currently functions to train and support a network of bioinformatics specialists serving individual Institutes at NIH. NCBI's CoreBio facility trains Core members identified by their respective institutes in the use of its bioinformatics tools. The Core members, in turn, support the use of NCBI tools and databases by researchers at their institutes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The training is provided over a 9-week period, with students attending lectures and completing practical exercises in the morning and returning to their regular workplace in the afternoon. The unitwork centers on one major topic each week and follows the rough schedule given below:
						</p>
						<p>
							WEEK 1: Introduction to the Sequence Databases
						</p>

						<title>Introduction</title>
						<p>
							This chapter contains tutorials for using Map Viewer. Step-by-step instructions are provided for several common biological research problems that can be addressed by exploiting the whole-genome and positional perspectives of Map Viewer. Please be aware that the examples in these tutorials may return different results when you execute them, because the underlying data may have been updated, but we hope that the framework for obtaining, interpreting, and processing your results will be sufficiently clear if that happens. Most of the examples are for human genes, but the same logic applies to other genomes as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that each of these tutorials is accompanied by a figure. If you are using this tutorial on the Web, we suggest that you open another browser window so that you can view the figure as you are reading the text. You are also encouraged to use Map Viewer interactively.
						</p>
						<p>
							We welcome any suggestions that you have for improving the existing tutorials or for adding new ones.

						<title>1. How Do I Obtain the Genomic Sequence around My Gene of Interest?</title>
						<p>
							There are many instances in molecular biological research when you may have only a cDNA sequence but need to have the nucleotide sequence that lies 5 or 3 to a gene or the introns for additional analyses. Because genomic sequence available from the public database may not have this annotation or may be so large as to make it difficult to retrieve only a region of interest, tools have been added to Map Viewer to make it easier to define, view, and download genomic sequence in multiple formats.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1681">
							<title>Direct Sequence Information via Map Viewer</title>
							<p>
								From the Map Viewer   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">homepage</ext-link>, select    Search Homo sapiens (human) from the pull-down menu, enter FMR1 in the box labeled    for , and then select    Go . On the results page, four entries are returned (  <italic>4 hits</italic>).   <italic>FMR1</italic>has been mapped on three different maps:   <italic>Genes_cyto, Genes_seq,</italic>and   <italic>Morbid</italic>. Select the    Genes_seq map to see the structure of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene. Two links to the right of the Genes_seq map are of use in retrieving the 5 and 3 flanking DNA, the    sv and    seq links (  <italic>boxed</italic>). At the top of the page,    Download/View Sequence/Evidence can also be used.
							</p>
							<p>
								The most informative maps, for the purpose of this example, are the Contig, Component, and Genes_seq maps. Selecting the    Genes_seq map will display the current gene model. To start our search for flanking DNAs, display the    Contig and    Component maps. To do so, select    Maps &amp; Options , and from the available maps, choose the    Contig map by left-clicking with the mouse. Select    ADD&gt;&gt; . Now add the    Component map. Next, make the Gene_seq map the master map in the display by left-clicking on the    Gene map under the    Maps Displayed (  <italic>left</italic>to   <italic>right</italic>) and selecting    Make Master/Move to Bottom: . Finally, select the    Contig map and choose the    Toggle Ruler to add a ruler (  <italic>[R]</italic>) to the display. This will guide you in finding your region of interest. Select    Apply . From   Figure 1, we can see that FMR1 has been annotated on a finished contig, NT_011537.9 (  <italic>c</italic>), and that the contig is built from two components in this region, AC016925.15 and L29074.1 [(  <italic>a</italic>) and (  <italic>b</italic>), respectively].

									<graphic mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="ch24f1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
								</fig>
							</p>
							<p>
								There are two links on the Map Viewer display that are used to view and download of the region of interest: the    seq link and the    Download/View Sequence/Evidence link (  <italic>boxed</italic>). The    seq link is displayed only when the Gene_seq map is made the master map in the display. Selecting the    seq link will open a window, prompting the user to enter a region to retrieve. This region can then be refined further by adjusting the position, in kilobase pairs. Selecting    Display Region will change the start and stop positions on the contig, where the gene has been annotated. The region can then be displayed and saved locally in FASTA or GenBank formats.
							</p>
							<p>
								Selecting the    Download/View Sequence/Evidence link from the main display page will generate the same window, but the initial coordinates are those spanning the entire region displayed by the Map Viewer rather than the region of a particular gene, as in the case above.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let us assume that we would like to download 5.0 kb of upstream DNA and 1.0 kb of downstream DNA. To define this region, we will need to follow the    seq link, which will open a new display showing the chromosome coordinates for   <italic>FMR1</italic>and the corresponding position on the contig. To adjust the region, simply enter the amount of desired upstream DNA and downstream DNA into the two    adjust by: input boxes provided, and select    Change Region . Notice that the corresponding region on the contig has adjusted to reflect this change in position. Now we can either display the data in GenBank or FASTA formats and save the data to a disk.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1683">
							<title>Using the Sequence Viewer</title>
							<p>
								Another tool for obtaining the desired sequence is the Sequence Viewer, available via the    sv link when the Gene_seq map is the master map. The Sequence Viewer presents a graphical view of the gene within the contig. The sequence is also annotated with the coding regions, RNA and gene features, Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms.   <italic>Blue arrows</italic>at the   <italic>top</italic>and   <italic>bottom</italic>of the display allow the user to navigate upstream or downstream. The    Get Subsequence link (  <italic>large, open arrow</italic>) at the   <italic>top</italic>of the    sv page allows the user to change the sequence range on the contig and will also display the reverse complement of the sequence. The specified region can then be displayed and saved locally in FASTA format.

						<title>2. If I Have Physical and/or Genetic Mapping Data, How Do I Use the Map Viewer to Find a Candidate Disease Gene in That Region?</title>
						<p>
							In this example, we will use the Map Viewer to look for human candidate genes in a region. The types of queries that can be posted to the Map Viewer that will address this type of question are queries by genetic marker or STS.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that Map Viewer supports queries by any named object positioned on a map so that it is possible to query by gene symbol or GenBank Accession number or any other object that might define your range of interest.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1685">
							<title>Querying by STSs</title>
							<p>
								To refine our search,  we will enter the names of two STSs. In the text box, enter sWXD113 OR DXS52 on chromosome X. Select    Find . We can see that these two STSs map to the distal region of the long arm of the X chromosome, Xq, by the   <italic>red tick marks</italic>that appear alongside the schematic of the X chromosome. These two STS markers have been mapped on several other maps that are also represented in the results. Select the    X chromosome   <italic>above</italic>the   <italic>red 3</italic>to see both markers in the same display. The Map Viewer page now displays three different maps, each showing the physical location of these two markers.
							</p>
							<p>
								The maps that are displayed include the UniG_Hs, Genes_seq, and STS maps. The UniG_Hs map shows the density of ESTs and mRNAs that align to the current assembly of the human genome. The Genes_seq map displays known and predicted genes that are annotated on the genomic contigs. The   <italic>rightmost</italic>map, the STS map in this case, is termed the master map and contains descriptive information about each map element (  Figure 2). The two STSs for which we are searching (  <italic>GDB:192503</italic>and   <italic>DXS52</italic>) are highlighted in   <italic>pink</italic>. To the   <italic>right</italic>of the display is a grid indicating other maps upon which these STSs are located. The   <italic>red dots</italic>(  <italic>circled</italic>) to the   <italic>left</italic>of each highlighted STS show the relative position of these STSs in the context of the two other maps. By default, a ruler is displayed alongside the STS map so that the region of interest can be localized further. Notice on the   <italic>far left</italic>of the page that there is an area where you can enter the region that you would like to display [(  <italic>a</italic>)].  
								<fig id="bid.1686">

								</fig>
							</p>
							<p>
								At the current resolution, it is not possible to view all of the information displayed on the three maps. Therefore, some adjustment will be necessary.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1687">
							<title>Identifying a Candidate Gene</title>
							<p>
								Narrow the region further using the ruler adjacent to the STS map as a guide. It is not necessary to display a ruler alongside the other two maps because they are all on the same coordinate system. In instances where sequence, genetic, cytogenetic, or radiation hybrid maps are being displayed in the same view, it is advisable to display additional rulers because the different maps show the mapped element on different coordinate systems (Kbp, cM, banding position, or centiRays, respectively). Enter the range 133.0 M to147.0 M in the   <italic>boxes</italic>to the   <italic>left</italic>of the page, in the    Region Shown [(  <italic>a</italic>)]. Select    Go . This is a slightly better view; however, there are many more genes in the region that can be displayed.
							</p>
							<p>
								To see all of the genes in the region defined by the two markers, select the    Data as Table View link (  <italic>boxed</italic>). The table that is generated lists all 144 genes in this region in a format easily read by people or computers. The table also preserves the links to additional gene-related resources seen in the graphical display, as well as reporting other objects in your displayed region. Please note that links are also provided to make it easy for you to download reports, not only of the objects in your map display, but other objects within the region defined by your display. This feature is especially useful if you are looking for other gene markers in your region of interest.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can also change the page length under    Maps &amp; Options to a number large enough so that all genes are displayed graphically on a single page. By default, Map Viewer will show 20 map elements on a page. When the Genes_seq map is made the master map, there will be information at the   <italic>top</italic>of the page, indicating how many genes have been labeled (  <italic>n</italic>= 20) and how many genes are in the region (  <italic>n</italic>= 144). To see all of the candidate genes in the specified region, go to    Maps &amp; Options and change the page length to the number of genes in the region (  <italic>n</italic>= 144) and then select    Apply .
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1688">
							<title>Interpreting Your Results</title>
							<p>
								At this point, you can now browse the description of the genes that are being displayed. Each gene or locus name is hyperlinked to LocusLink, where a detailed report about the gene or locus is provided. If the gene or locus of interest has supporting EST and mRNA data, then you can select the UniGene cluster number and link to UniGene, where more detailed information is provided about this gene, including its pattern of expression. LocusLink also provides connections to BLink and thus indirectly to reports of related proteins in the protein database and to viewers of protein structure, if your protein of interest is related to a protein for which the structure is known (see also Exercise 8 in this chapter).
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1689">
							<title>Other Ways to Query</title>
							<p>
								The example above summarizes the approach taken when defining a region of interest by entering names of markers in the query box. Gene symbols, reference SNP names, and GenBank Accession numbers for ESTs could also be used. It should also be noted that when a chromosome is displayed, you may also submit a query using the    Region Shown boxes in the bar at the left side.

						<title>3. How Can I Find and Display a Gene with the Map Viewer?</title>
						<p>
							In this example, we will locate and display the human gene implicated in Fragile X syndrome using the Map Viewer. We can find the gene beginning with several types of data. Refer to Figure 3. For these examples, we assume you are starting from the human-specific Map Viewer. If you instead are starting from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">homepage</ext-link>, please remember to select Homo sapiens (human) as the species.

							</fig>
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1692">
							<title>By Gene Symbol</title>
							<p>
								If we are fortunate enough to know the official gene symbol for the Fragile X gene,   <italic>FMR1</italic>, or an alternative symbol such as   <italic>FRAXA</italic>, we can type the symbol into the search box at the   <italic>top</italic>of the page and press the    Find button. This gene has been annotated on the genome, and the gene symbol   <italic>FMR1</italic>appears on the    Genes_seq ,    Genes_cyto , and the    Morbid maps. To generate a Map Viewer display that includes all three maps, select the link to    all matches .
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1693">
							<title>By Linkage to a Disease</title>
							<p>
								Genes that are linked to a disease in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) are referenced on the Morbid map and can be found by searching with a disease name or phenotype. In our case, fragile-X can be used. Using this query, we pick up hits to genes related to   <italic>FMR1</italic>, as well as our intended gene. Selecting the    FMR1 link generates a display of the gene.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1694">
							<title>By Physical Marker</title>
							<p>
								The   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene contains the STS, STS-X69962 [(  <italic>b</italic>)]; therefore, we can also use the name of this STS to find it, as in the case of a gene symbol. The search yields a table of hits showing that STS-X69962 appears on the STS map. Selecting the    STS link gives us a Map Viewer display of the STS we found but not of the gene we sought. To get the gene into the Map Viewer display, we can add the Genes_seq map to the display. Although   <italic>FMR1</italic>is located on the Genes_seq map rather than the STS map, because the coordinate systems used in different maps are synchronized, we can see the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene if we ask for the Genes_seq track in the region corresponding to the hit on the STS map. To do this, we can select the    Maps &amp; Options link [(  <italic>a</italic>)], highlight the    Gene map from the list of    available maps in the   <italic>left-hand box</italic>, and select the    ADD&gt;&gt; button to add this map to the list of displayed maps. After selecting the    Apply button, the Gene map is added to the Map Viewer display. Note, however, that the view is limited to a very small 200-base pair portion of the gene. This is because we are still focused on the STS returned by our initial search. To see an expanded view, we must zoom out using the zoom control located directly over the thumbnail chromosome map in the   <italic>blue sidebar</italic>[(  <italic>d</italic>)]. Mousing over the control indicates that we are viewing 1/10,000th of chromosome X. We can click further up on the control to view 1/1,000th of the chromosome and see most of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene. The   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene is now centered in the Map Viewer display, and our STS hit is marked in   <italic>red</italic>.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1695">
							<title>By Region</title>
							<p>
								Often, a gene is known to reside only in a particular region. Suppose that we know only that   <italic>FMR1</italic>resides somewhere between markers DXS532 and DXS7389 [(  <italic>e</italic>) and (  <italic>c</italic>), respectively]. We can use a query containing a Boolean OR to force the Map Viewer to search for both markers simultaneously. In this case, a query to Map Viewer of DXS532 OR DXS7389 generates a number of hits to various physical maps, all to a region on chromosome X, which is marked in   <italic>red</italic>under the    X chromosome graphic. If we select the chromosome    X link under the chromosome graphic, the Map Viewer display shows marker hits on several physical maps, highlighted in   <italic>red</italic>, over a fairly large sequence region from about 141 to 142 megabases. To generate a tabular listing of all the genes in this region, select the    Data as Table View link to the   <italic>left</italic>of the Map Viewer display. With a genetic map, such as the Genethon map, as the master map, it is also possible to define or refine the region of display using coordinates in centimorgans. In the case of   <italic>FMR1</italic>, entering a range of 176198 into the    Region Shown boxes generates a display of the genes falling within that range.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1696">
							<title>By Sequence Homology</title>
							<p>
								Suppose that we have the sequence of the mouse homolog of the human   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene and want to locate it on the human genome assembly. We might consult the Human/Mouse homology map at NCBI as the most direct approach for mapped genes, but let us assume that the human homolog of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene is unmapped. In this case, we can perform a BLAST sequence similarity search with the mouse sequence to attempt to locate the corresponding human gene. We will use the mouse   <italic>Fmr1</italic>mRNA sequence, taken from NCBI's LocusLink database (Accession number NM_002024), as our probe and follow the link to    BLAST search the human genome located at the   <italic>top</italic>of the Map Viewer search page; type the above Accession number into the BLAST form, and press the    Search button. Such searches are extremely fast because they make use of an NCBI program called MegaBLAST, designed especially for this purpose. In the MegaBLAST results, the    Genomic View button near the   <italic>top</italic>of the page provides an entry point into a Map Viewer display. The MegaBLAST hits are indicated by a   <italic>red mark</italic>on chromosome X, and links to hits are provided in the table at the   <italic>bottom</italic>of the page, as in the searches by gene symbol or marker. In the case of any MegaBLAST search, all hits are to sequences [(  <italic>f</italic>)] on the    Contig map; therefore, it is the contig link (Accession number beginning with NT_) that we follow to view the hits in their genomic context. Following this link brings us to a display of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene, with the BLAST hits indicated as highlighted hits on the contig map and   <italic>colored ticks</italic>on the other maps (  <italic>large, expanded view</italic>).

						<title>4. How Can I Analyze a Gene Using the Map Viewer?</title>
						<p>
							We will analyze the <italic>FMR1</italic>gene. To find this gene in the human Map Viewer, enter FMR1 into the query box and select the  Genes_seq map link in the table of search results.
						</p>
						<p>
							To begin the analysis, we can select the link in the <italic>blue sidebar</italic>entitled  Data as Table View to see a tabular listing of the chromosomal coordinates of  the features visible in the current Map Viewer display. In the section of the table giving features on the Genes_seq map, we find that the <italic>FMR1</italic>gene extends from 141519781 to 141558823, a span of about 40,000 base pairs. We can now return  to the graphical Map Viewer display and limit our view to this region by entering this range into the  Region Shown boxes [Figure 4, (<italic>a</italic>)] in the <italic>blue sidebar</italic>and pressing the  Go button. The coordinate system operative in the  Region Shown boxes is that of the <italic>rightmost</italic>map in the Map Viewer display, called the master map; be sure that the Genes_seq map is the master before changing the coordinates for the region shown.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are now ready to select the maps to display. The maps displayed will depend on the sort of analysis intended; however, one useful set of maps includes the Genes_seq, Contig, Comp, GScan, UniG_Hs, RNA, and gbDNA maps. This set of maps can be selected for viewing using the panel invoked by the  Maps &amp; Options link (<italic>large, open arrow</italic>). A Map Viewer display of the <italic>FMR1</italic>gene using this set of maps is given in Figure 4.

							<title>The Genes_seq Track</title>
							<p>
								In   Figure 4, the Genes_seq map, which displays annotated genes, is the master map and is the first one we will examine. The   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene comprises 18 exons, represented by   <italic>thick lines</italic>, interspersed over about 40,000 base pairs of sequence. The gene is drawn to the   <italic>right</italic>of the Genes_seq track line and therefore runs from the   <italic>top</italic>of the display to the   <italic>bottom</italic>and is coded on the plus strand in the human genome assembly. Genes located on the opposite strand run from the   <italic>bottom</italic>of the display upward and are shown to the   <italic>left</italic>of the Genes_seq track. The   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene is displayed in   <italic>orange</italic>, which indicates that the alignment between the genomic sequence and the   <italic>FMR1</italic>transcript sequences that were used to produce the gene model was not perfect;   <italic>blue</italic>alignments are of the best quality. The 3-most exon (  <italic>bottom inset</italic>) of the gene is exceptionally large and probably includes a significant untranslated region. To verify this, we can select the    sv link (  <italic>boxed</italic>) to the   <italic>right</italic>of the Genes_seq map to invoke the Sequence Viewer, which shows the sequence of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene. In the Sequence Viewer, we can navigate to the display for the last exon, number 18, to see that the coding sequence ends toward the beginning of the exon and that the majority of the exon is indeed untranslated.
							</p>

						<sec id="bid.1700">
							<title>The RNA Track</title>
							<p>
								The RNA or Transcript map shows the alignment of a single mRNA sequence to the genome, and in this case, the pattern of exons produced matches exactly that shown on the Genes_seq map. If additional splice variants are sequenced, multiple alignments will be shown on the RNA track, and the gene model given on the Genes_seq track will be a composite model made up of all the exons implied by these alignments.
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1701">
							<title>The GScan Track</title>
							<p>
								The GenomeScan track shows gene predictions made using GenomeScan that are independent of supporting mRNA alignments. The GenomeScan model for   <italic>FMR1</italic>is very similar to the model shown on the Genes_seq track; however, there are differences, and the alignment-based model shown on the Genes_seq track covers exons that are part of two different GenomeScan models (  <italic>topmost inset</italic>). Note also that the GenomeScan model covers only the initial translated portion of the large 3 exon of the transcript-based model (  <italic>bottom inset</italic>).
							</p>
						</sec>
						<sec id="bid.1702">
							<title>The UniG_Hs Track</title>
							<p>
								Both the predicted model (GScan) and the alignment-based model (Genes_seq) can be compared to the mapping of ESTs on the UniG_Hs  track. The   <italic>bars</italic>extending to the   <italic>left</italic>of the UniG_Hs track line depict EST mapping density, whereas the   <italic>lines</italic>to the   <italic>right</italic>connect ESTs arising from common UniGene clusters. From the UniG_Hs track, it is clear that most of the exons arising from either of the two gene models have some EST support, and that most of the ESTs that map to these regions are members of UniGene cluster Hs.89764 (  <italic>boxed, center</italic>). Selecting the    Hs.89764 link leads to the   <italic>FMR1</italic>UniGene cluster.

						<sec id="bid.1754">
							<title>The UniG_Mm Track</title>
							<p>
								This map is comparable to the UniG_Hs track but is based instead on alignment of mouse cDNA sequences (conventional and EST). In this example, the exons suggested by the alignment of mouse cDNAs is comparable to that based on alignment of human cDNAs.

							<title>The Contig Track</title>
							<p>
								Looking across to the Contig track, we can see that the gene maps to a contig that is drawn in   <italic>blue</italic>, indicating that the contig is derived from high quality, finished sequence. If we consult the Component map (  <italic>Comp</italic>), we can see that the portion of the contig containing the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene is composed of two overlapping finished sequences, also drawn in   <italic>blue</italic>. Because the sequence underlying the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene is finished, rather than draft sequence, the   <italic>FMR1</italic>sequence and structure are likely to remain stable in future human genome assemblies.

						<title>5. How Can I Create My Own Transcript Models with the Map Viewer?</title>
						<p>
							The Map Viewer displays the alignment of transcripts, such as mRNA GenBank sequences and RefSeqs, to genomic sequence and shows the positions of predicted genes, but it does not stop there. By using a utility called the ModelMaker, it is possible to combine the alignment evidence with the results of gene prediction to construct novel transcripts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Beginning with the standard Map Viewer display for the gene <italic>FMR1</italic>, we can display the Gscan and Genes_seq maps in parallel, as shown in Figure 5. The GScan map shows gene predictions made by the GenomeScan program. The Genes_seq track shows the exons implied by the composite alignment of transcripts, such as NCBI mRNA RefSeqs, to the genome. There are two <italic>boxed regions</italic>in the Map Viewer display. The <italic>upper boxed</italic>region shows that the GenomeScan model for <italic>FMR1</italic>begins at a point that is part of an intron in the transcript-based model. Furthermore, there is a separate GenomScan model upstream of the first that overlaps with the initial exon of the transcript-based model. It would be of interest to investigate whether the two GenomeScan models could be fused to produce a longer transcript. In the <italic>lower boxed</italic>region, we see that the transcript-based model includes an exon lacking in the GenomeScan model. Perhaps we can create a model transcript based on the fusion of the two GenomeScan models that also includes the extra exon seen in the transcript-based model.

						</p>
						<p>
							To attempt this synthesis, we first select the  mm link [(<italic>a</italic>)] to the <italic>right</italic>of the <italic>FMR1</italic>gene link on the Genes_seq track to invoke the ModelMaker. A number of alignments between transcript or model sequences and the genomic contig upon which <italic>FMR1</italic>lies, NT_011537 [(<italic>b</italic>)], are given at the <italic>top</italic>of the ModelMaker display, and the implied exons resulting from these alignments are shown just <italic>below</italic>, numbered sequentially in the  Putative exons pallet. We may choose any of these exons for inclusion in our model by selecting it. We can also choose a complete set of exons from an existing alignment by selecting the  set link next to an alignment. Because we plan to begin with the GenomeScan model, we can select the  set link next to the second alignment from the <italic>bottom</italic>to start. This gives us an initial model identical to that of the GenomeScan prediction and yields, as its longest Open Reading Frame (ORF), an ORF of 600 amino acids. We can also see the second, small, GenomeScan-predicted model at the <italic>far left</italic>of the ModelMaker display. We hope to fuse this model with the larger model. The second model comprises three closely spaced exons, resembling a single exon in the display, numbered 24 in the  Putative exons pallet. Selecting exons 2 and 3 adds them to the model (<italic>first boxed pair</italic>in the ModelMaker display). At this point, the longest ORF detected in the transcript has increased to 762 amino acids. If we try to include exon 4, however, we drop back to 600 amino acids because of the introduction of an internal stop codon; therefore, we can remove exon 4 from our model with another click. Finally, we can select exon 22, which is the exon from the alignment-based model that we want to include, and notice that the longest ORF detected has risen to 823 amino acids [(<italic>c</italic>)]. Because long ORFs without stop codons occur rarely by chance, this transcript model is promising. To explore further, we can select the  ORF Finder link to generate a graphical view of all ORFs found in the transcript, including the longest ORF, and subject the translation of the latter to a BLAST search. In this case, we find that the majority of the predicted protein matches the <italic>FMR1</italic>gene product but that we have introduced some novel peptide sequence at the amino-terminal end as well as some near the carboxy terminus.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this example, there were multiple, putative, full-length mRNAs. Please note that ESTs can be added to the display by selecting  add ESTs (Figure 5, upper right-hand corner). Additional exons and splicing patterns may then be available to be considered in your model. This feature may be of particular importance if most of the evidence for splicing and exons comes from ESTs rather than complete mRNAs.

						<title>6. Using the Mouse Map Viewer</title>
						<p>
							This assembly can be displayed by using Map Viewer for the mouse. In this particular case, the official symbol for the human and mouse genes is the same; therefore, a query by symbol returns the expected result. If this were not the case, however, it is also possible to search the mouse genome by the human sequence using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/page.cgi?F=MmBlast.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BLAST the Mouse Genome</ext-link>. Simulating this, you can see that the best match for the human sequence is for a gene labeled LOC207836. If you check this in LocusLink, you will see that this is now annotated as Fmr1.

							<title>By Human/Mouse Homology Map</title>
							<p>
								Consider an example in which we want to know whether there is a human/mouse synteny region that includes our favorite gene,   <italic>FMR1</italic>. To begin, enter FMR1 into the Map Viewer search box and press the    Find button. Selecting the gene name in the results table leads us to a Map Viewer display of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene with the Genes_seq map, UniG_Hs map, and Genes_cyto maps shown. In   Figure 6, the Genes_cyto map has been replaced with the UniG_Mm map. Selecting the    hm link (  <italic>boxed</italic>) to the   <italic>right</italic>of the Genes_seq map leads to the human/mouse homology maps. One can choose between two slightly different variants of human genome assembly (NCBI and UCSC). Three sources of mouse mapping data are available: the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) map, Jackson Lab map, and the Whitehead/MRC Radiation Hybrid map. Either of the two human maps may be compared with either of the two mouse maps.

								Let us choose the NCBI   <italic>versus</italic>MGD variant and then check for synteny in the region of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>homologs in the two species. Because our primary interest is the human gene   <italic>FMR1</italic>, we select NCBI   <italic>versus</italic>MGD_Hs, and the comparative map will appear. The row corresponding to the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene is highlighted (  <italic>inset</italic>). The mouse homolog, called   <italic>Fmr1</italic>, is also positioned on chromosome X, and the order of genes surrounding it is conserved in both genomes. Available STS data are indicated by a   <italic>green dot</italic>that is a hyperlink to UniSTS. Links to the Map Viewer (select    Cytogenetic map position ) and LocusLink (select    Gene Symbol ) are available for each pair of genes. The user can examine the pairwise BLAST alignment that is accessible by selecting a chromosome color-coded dot preceding the mouse gene name. A dot-matrix similarity plot on the pairwise alignment page makes it easy to visually estimate the differences in sequences of the two genes. It is interesting to see that the similarity between   <italic>FMR1</italic>and   <italic>Fmr1</italic>actually extends past the coding regions.

It is apparent that the EST mapping patterns on the two UniGene maps are similar for   <italic>FMR1</italic>. This indicates a similarity at the expressed sequence level but does not indicate a similar gene structure because both sets of ESTs are being mapped to the same human genomic sequence.

							The most complete assembly of the mouse genome available at NCBI is the Mouse Genome Consortium Version 3 WGS assembly. This assembly can be displayed using the mouse version of the Map Viewer; however, the mouse homolog of   <italic>FMR1</italic>is not labeled as such in this assembly; therefore, we cannot find it using a simple search by gene name. We can overcome this obstacle by searching the mouse genome with the human mRNA sequence using mouse genome BLAST.

						<title>7. How Can I Find Members of a Gene Family Using the Map Viewer?</title>
						<p>
							Finding members of a gene family is not straightforward by any means. However, the Map Viewer can be used to flag sets of genes that are related, either by nomenclature or by sequence similarity.
						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1714">
							<title>By Common Annotation</title>
							<p>
								Consider the gene   <italic>FMR1</italic>. Let us assume we do not know much about genes from this family, but we suppose (recognizing that we may have cause to regret this supposition) that they all share the common root name FMR. We start our search from the main Map Viewer page by entering FMR* (the asterisk is a wild-card symbol) into the    Search box and pressing the    Find button. This search results in several hits, and some obviously do not belong to the   <italic>FMR1</italic>family (cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting proteins 1 and 2, FMRFAL); but two genes on chromosome X (  <italic>FMR2</italic>and   <italic>FMR3</italic>) and one on chromosome 17 (  <italic>FMR1L2</italic>)  look promising. By selecting the chromosome X    all matches link, we go to the graphical representation of the genomic region containing three FMR genes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Selecting the gene name (the rows for the FMR* query hits are highlighted) invokes a corresponding LocusLink page that serves as a portal to available information for the gene, including the precomputed results of a similarity search against the nr database. Go to the NCBI Reference Sequences section of the LocusLink page and select the BLAST Link (   BL ) link. BLink displays a schematic representation of BLAST alignments with links to displays of the best hit from each organism, protein domains found in the query sequence, or sequences similar to the query that have known 3D structures.
							</p>
							<p>
								When we look at the BLAST summary for   <italic>FMR1</italic>, we find neither   <italic>FMR2</italic>nor   <italic>FMR3</italic>. We did not expect   <italic>FMR3</italic>to show up because it had not been mapped on the Genes_seq map, which suggested that its sequence is not yet known. However, why do we not see   <italic>FMR2</italic>? If we use LocusLink to retrieve the Reference Sequences for the   <italic>FMR1</italic>and   <italic>FMR2</italic>gene products (NP_002015 and NP_002016) and perform a pairwise BLAST comparison, we find that there is no significant similarity between the two sequences. Apparently, the names of FMR genes do not reflect common sequence features but rather a physiological condition, fragile X mental retardation syndrome, associated with this gene. In this sense, the two are members of a group or family, but they show sequence similarity only in the pathological trinucleotide repeats (CGG)  
								<sub>

						<sec id="bid.1715">

								The BLink page lists two annotated human homologs of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene, called fragile X mental retardation, autosomal homologs 1 and 2 (FXR1 and FXR2). They show a significant similarity to the FMR1 protein and possess the same functional domains (K-homology RNA-binding domains documented in the LocusLink reports). Selecting the    Score column link invokes a page with the results of pairwise BLAST, as well as a visual representation of similarity between the two proteins (a variant of the dot matrix similarity plot).

						<sec id="bid.1716">
							<title>By Sequence Similarity to a Query</title>
							<p>
								To see whether there are undocumented homologs of   <italic>FMR1</italic>in the genome, return to the Map Viewer maps page for the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene and select the    BLAST the Human Genome link. Enter the Accession number for the FMR1 protein taken from the LocusLink report (NP_002015) into the    Search window, select    Genome as the database,    tblastn as the BLAST program, and search. A tblastn search takes a protein sequence as a query and translates a nucleotide database in all reading frames to find any coding regions, documented or undocumented, that might code for a protein similar to the query. Such a search is very sensitive because it is tolerant of differences in codon usage as well as of insertions and deletions.
							</p>
							<p>
								The results of such a search are shown in   Figure 7. BLAST hits to regions on four chromosomes are shown in the genomic overview, indicated by   <italic>small tick marks</italic>. There are 14 hits to chromosome X, clustered near the end of the q-arm. These hits are to   <italic>FMR1</italic>, which is located in band Xq27.3. There are also 5 hits apiece to chromosomes 3 and 17 [(  <italic>a</italic>) and (  <italic>b</italic>), respectively]. These  hits are to known homologs of   <italic>FMR1, FXR1,</italic>and   <italic>FXR2</italic>. Selecting the links below the chromosome graphic or on the appropriate contig link in the table below leads to a graphical display of the hits on the contig, as shown in the two   <italic>insets</italic>.

						</p>
						<sec id="bid.1719">
							<title>Finding Protein Domains in a Gene Product</title>
							<p>
								For example, one might be interested in the domain structure of the gene product. Let us use the human   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene as an example. On the main Map Viewer page, enter FMR1 into the    Search for window and press the    Find button. Select the    FMR1 link to display three maps (cyto, UniG_Hs, and Genes_seq) of the   <italic>FMR1</italic>locus on chromosome X. Selecting the gene name next to the gene model (  <italic>FMR1</italic>) leads to the LocusLink page, which is not only a compilation of genomic, genetic, and reference data related to the gene but also a gateway to the external resources and NCBI tools and databases. The LocusLink report for   <italic>FMR1</italic>is linked to precomputed BLAST results for the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene product. Selecting    BL (BLink, for BLAST link) invokes a page with a schematic view of the BLAST comparison of the FMR1 protein against the non-redundant (nr) database. The BLink page lists database hits to the FMR1 protein, sorted according to their BLAST similarity scores. Results may be reformatted by selecting    Sort by Taxonomy Proximity to cluster hits from the same species.
							</p>
							<p>
								To see the functional domains that have been identified in the FMR1 protein, select the Conserved Domains Database (CDD)    Search button. The resulting page shows two hits to the KH-domain from the SMART database and one hit to the KH domain in the Pfam database. Notice that one of the SMART domain hits is a partial hit, as indicated by the   <italic>jagged edge</italic>in the schematic representation.

								We can easily see whether there exists a three-dimensional structure that includes these conserved domains. The   <italic>pink dot</italic>preceding the domain name in the BLink    Description of Alignments section  leads to a display of the corresponding three-dimensional structure using Cn3D, the NCBI macromolecular viewer available over the Web. The Pfam and SMART domains are linked to two 3D structures (1K1G_A and 1J4W_A). The CDD page also lists other sequences that have the same domain and shows their multiple sequence alignments.

							<title>Searching for Similar Domains in Genomic Sequence</title>

								Cut and paste the sequence of the KH-domain from the FMR1 protein and run a genome-specific BLAST search. We will use the tblastn program to compare the 44-amino acid sequence of the KH domain to the nucleotide sequence of the human genome. The results will show us other regions of the genome with the potential to code for this domain. Of unit, we already know from the BLink page that there are some autosomal homologs, but we do not know whether they actually contain the KH RNA-binding domain. The obvious caveat is that some pseudogenes might contain the domain as well. Our tblastn search returns 4 hits, one being the   <italic>FMR1</italic>gene itself on the X chromosome, and three others on chromosomes 3, 12, and 17. Select the    Genome View button in the Genome BLAST results to see the positions of the hits on the chromosomes. One may then select the names of sequences producing significant alignments to invoke a Map Viewer display that shows the corresponding maps and report the names of the loci. As expected, hits to chromosomes 3 and 17 correspond to the autosomal homologs FXR1 and FXR2. The hit to chromosome 12 corresponds to the hypothetical protein HSPC232, and the Map Viewer display for this BLAST hit is shown (  Figure 8). The hit is to a segment of intronic sequence, rather than to an exon, and is without supporting human EST alignments. There are, however, mouse ESTs mapping to this region (  <italic>lower inset</italic>), and there is also a GenomeScan model that covers the hit; therefore, the BLAST hit may indeed represent coding sequence. Selecting the    Blast hit link (  <italic>boxed</italic>) leads to an alignment (  <italic>upper inset</italic>) that indicates a good match between our 44-amino acid domain sequence and a protein translation of the genomic sequence. If we map this 44-amino acid sequence onto the structure of 1K1G using Cn3D, we see that it covers a module consisting of two alpha helices and a three-stranded beta sheet (  <italic>leftmost inset</italic>). It appears reasonable that our domain hit may represent an exon of the   <italic>HSPC232</italic>gene. To follow this line of analysis, the next step might be to produce a transcript model incorporating this new exon using the Model Maker (see the Model Maker exercise in this series).
